	"summary": "Security update for qemu",
	"details": "\nThis update for qemu fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-2620: In CIRRUS_BLTMODE_MEMSYSSRC mode the bitblit copy routine cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo failed to check the memory region, allowing for an out-of-bounds write that allows for privilege escalation (bsc#1024972)\n- CVE-2017-2615: An error in the bitblt copy operation could have allowed a malicious guest administrator to cause an out of bounds memory access, possibly leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation (bsc#1023004)\n- CVE-2017-5856: The MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1023053)\n- CVE-2016-9776: The ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller emulator support was vulnerable to an infinite loop issue while receiving packets in 'mcf_fec_receive'. A privileged user/process inside guest could have used this issue to crash the Qemu process on the host leading to DoS (bsc#1013285)\n- CVE-2016-9911: The USB EHCI Emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue while processing packet data in 'ehci_init_transfer'. A guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for the host (bsc#1014111)\n- CVE-2016-9907: The USB redirector usb-guest support was vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw when destroying the USB redirector in 'usbredir_handle_destroy'.  A guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for a host (bsc#1014109)\n- CVE-2016-9921: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1014702)\n- CVE-2016-9922: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1014702)\n- CVE-2016-10155: The virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1021129)\n- CVE-2017-5526: The ES1370 audio device emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1020589)\n- CVE-2017-5525: The ac97 audio device emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1020491)\n- CVE-2017-5667: The SDHCI device emulation support was vulnerable to an OOB heap access issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1022541)\n- CVE-2017-5898: The CCID Card device emulator support was vulnerable to an integer overflow allowing a privileged user inside the guest to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS (bnc#1023907)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Fix post script for qemu-guest-agent rpm to actually activate the guest agent at rpm install time\n- Fixed various inaccuracies in cirrus vga device emulation\n- Fixed cause of infrequent migration failures from bad virtio device state (bsc#1020928)\n- Fixed virtio interface failure (bsc#1015048)\n- Fixed graphical update errors introduced by previous security fix (bsc#1016779)\n- Fixed uint64 property parsing and add regression tests (bsc#937125)\n",
