	"summary": "Security update for xen",
	"details": "\nThis update for xen fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-5973: A infinite loop while doing control transfer in xhci_kick_epctx allowed privileged user inside the guest to crash the host process resulting in DoS (bsc#1025188)\n- CVE-2016-10155: The virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1024183)\n- CVE-2017-2620: In CIRRUS_BLTMODE_MEMSYSSRC mode the bitblit copy routine cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo failed to check the memory region, allowing for an out-of-bounds write that allows for privilege escalation (bsc#1024834)\n- CVE-2017-5856: The MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1024186)\n- CVE-2017-5898: The CCID Card device emulator support was vulnerable to an integer overflow flaw allowing a privileged user to crash the Qemu process on the host resulting in DoS (bsc#1024307)\n- CVE-2017-2615: An error in the bitblt copy operation could have allowed a malicious guest administrator to cause an out of bounds memory access, possibly leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation (bsc#1023004)\n- CVE-2014-8106: A heap-based buffer overflow in the Cirrus VGA emulator allowed local guest users to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to blit regions (bsc#907805)\n- CVE-2017-5579: The 16550A UART serial device emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1022627)\n- CVE-2016-9907: The USB redirector usb-guest support was vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw when destroying the USB redirector in 'usbredir_handle_destroy'.  A guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for a host (bsc#1014490)\n- CVE-2016-9911: The USB EHCI Emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue while processing packet data in 'ehci_init_transfer'. A guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for the host (bsc#1014507)\n- CVE-2016-9921: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1015169)\n- CVE-2016-9922: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1015169)\n- CVE-2016-9101: A memory leak in hw/net/eepro100.c allowed local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and QEMU process crash) by repeatedly unplugging an i8255x (PRO100) NIC device (bsc#1013668)\n- CVE-2016-9776: The ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller emulator support was vulnerable to an infinite loop issue while receiving packets in 'mcf_fec_receive'. A privileged user/process inside guest could have used this issue to crash the Qemu process on the host leading to DoS (bsc#1013657)\n- A malicious guest could have, by frequently rebooting over extended periods of time, run the host system out of memory, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) (bsc#1022871)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- bsc#1000195: Prevent panic on CPU0 while booting on SLES 11 SP3\n- bsc#1002496: Added support for reloading clvm in block-dmmd block-dmmd\n- bsc#987002: Prevent crash of domU' after they were migrated from SP3 HV to SP4\n ",
