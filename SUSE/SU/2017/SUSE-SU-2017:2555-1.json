	"details": "This update for wireshark to version 2.2.9 fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-13767: The MSDP dissector could have gone into an infinite loop.\n  This was addressed by adding length validation (bsc#1056248).\n- CVE-2017-13766: The Profinet I/O dissector could have crash with an\n  out-of-bounds write. This was addressed by adding string validation\n  (bsc#1056249).\n- CVE-2017-13765: The IrCOMM dissector had a buffer over-read and application\n  crash. This was addressed by adding length validation (bsc#1056251).\n- CVE-2017-9766: PROFINET IO data with a high recursion depth allowed remote\n  attackers to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion) in the\n  dissect_IODWriteReq function (bsc#1045341).\n- CVE-2017-9617: Deeply nested DAAP data may have cause stack exhaustion\n  (uncontrolled recursion) in the dissect_daap_one_tag function in the DAAP\n  dissector (bsc#1044417).\n",
