	"summary": "Security update for php53",
	"details": "\nThis update for php53 fixes the following issues:\n\nThis security issue was fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-7272: PHP enabled potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port syntax was recognized, fsockopen used the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second argument of the function (bsc#1031246)\n- CVE-2016-6294: The locale_accept_from_http function in ext/intl/locale/locale_methods.c did not properly restrict calls to the ICU uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long argument (bsc#1035111).\n- CVE-2017-9227: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in mbstring in PHP. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression searching. Invalid handling of reg->dmin in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer. (bsc#1040883)\n- CVE-2017-9226: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in mbstring in PHP. A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption. (bsc#1040889)\n- CVE-2017-9224: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in mbstring in PHP. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in match_at() during regular expression searching. A logical error involving order of validation and access in match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer. (bsc#1040891)\n\n",
