	"summary": "Security update for qemu",
	"details": "This update for qemu fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-9330: USB OHCI Emulation in qemu allowed local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by leveraging an incorrect return value (bsc#1042159).\n- CVE-2017-8379: Memory leak in the keyboard input event handlers support allowed local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (host memory consumption) by rapidly generating large keyboard events (bsc#1037334).\n- CVE-2017-8309: Memory leak in the audio/audio.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by repeatedly starting and stopping audio capture (bsc#1037242).\n- CVE-2017-7493: The VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, was vulnerable to an improper access control issue. It could occur while accessing virtfs metadata files in mapped-file security mode. A guest user could have used this flaw to escalate their privileges inside guest (bsc#1039495).\n- CVE-2017-7377: The v9fs_create and v9fs_lcreate functions in hw/9pfs/9p.c allowed local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (file descriptor or memory consumption) via vectors related to an already in-use fid (bsc#1032075).\n- CVE-2017-8086: A memory leak in the v9fs_list_xattr function in hw/9pfs/9p-xattr.c allowed local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving the orig_value variable (bsc#1035950).\n- CVE-2017-5973: A infinite loop while doing control transfer in xhci_kick_epctx allowed privileged user inside the guest to crash the host process resulting in DoS (bsc#1025109)\n- CVE-2017-5987: The sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks function in hw/sd/sdhci.c allowed local OS guest privileged users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and QEMU process crash) via vectors involving the transfer mode register during multi block transfer (bsc#1025311).\n- CVE-2017-6505: The ohci_service_ed_list function in hw/usb/hcd-ohci.c allowed local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors involving the number of link endpoint list descriptors (bsc#1028184)\n- CVE-2016-9603: A privileged user within the guest VM could have caused a heap overflow in the device model process, potentially escalating their privileges to that of the device model process (bsc#1028656)\n- CVE-2017-7718: hw/display/cirrus_vga_rop.h allowed local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and QEMU process crash) via vectors related to copying VGA data via the cirrus_bitblt_rop_fwd_transp_ and cirrus_bitblt_rop_fwd_ functions (bsc#1034908)\n- CVE-2017-7980: An out-of-bounds r/w access issues in the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support allowed privileged user inside guest to use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code on a host with privileges of Qemu process on the host (bsc#1035406)\n- CVE-2017-8112: hw/scsi/vmw_pvscsi.c allowed local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via the message ring page count (bsc#1036211).\n- CVE-2017-9375: The USB xHCI controller emulator support was vulnerable to an infinite recursive call loop issue, which allowed a privileged user inside guest to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS (bsc#1042800).\n- CVE-2017-9374: Missing free of 's->ipacket', causes a host memory leak, allowing for DoS (bsc#1043073).\n- CVE-2017-9373: The IDE AHCI Emulation support was vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue, which allowed a privileged user inside guest to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1042801).\n- CVE-2017-8380: The MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support was vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read access issue which allowed a privileged user inside guest to read host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1037336).\n- CVE-2016-9602: The VirtFS host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support was vulnerable to an improper link following issue which allowed a privileged user inside guest to access host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a host (bsc#1020427).\n- CVE-2017-7471: The VirtFS host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support was vulnerable to an improper access control issue which allowed a privileged user inside guest to access host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a host (bsc#1034866).\n- Fix privilege escalation in TCG mode of QEMU. This is not considered a security issue by the upstream project, but is included as additional hardening (bsc#1030624)\n- Fix potential DoS in virtfs\n- CVE-2016-10028: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to an out of bounds memory access issue allowing a guest user to crash the Qemu process instance on a host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1017084, bsc#1016503)\n- CVE-2016-10029: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to an OOB read issue allowing a guest user to crash the Qemu process instance resulting in Dos (bsc#1017081, bsc#1016504)\n- CVE-2017-5579: The 16550A UART serial device emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1021741)\n- CVE-2017-9503: The MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support was vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue which allowed a privileged user inside guest to crash the Qemu process on the host resulting in DoS (bsc#1043296).\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n\n- Enable MONITOR/MWAIT support for guests (bsc#1031142)\n",
