	"summary": "Security update for qemu",
	"details": "\nThis update for qemu fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-5898: The CCID Card device emulator support was vulnerable to an integer overflow flaw allowing a privileged user to crash the Qemu process on the host resulting in DoS (bsc#1023907).\n- CVE-2017-5857: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue allowing a guest user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1023073).\n- CVE-2017-2620: In CIRRUS_BLTMODE_MEMSYSSRC mode the bitblit copy routine cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo failed to check the memory region, allowing for an out-of-bounds write that allows for privilege escalation (bsc#1024972)\n- CVE-2017-2615: An error in the bitblt copy operation could have allowed a malicious guest administrator to cause an out of bounds memory access, possibly leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation (bsc#1023004)\n- CVE-2017-5856: The MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1023053)\n- CVE-2016-9921: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1014702)\n- CVE-2016-9922: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1014702)\n- CVE-2016-10029: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to an OOB read issue allowing a guest user to crash the Qemu process instance resulting in Dos (bsc#1017081).\n- CVE-2016-10028: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to an out of bounds memory access issue allowing a guest user to crash the Qemu process instance on a host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1017084).\n- CVE-2016-10155: The virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1021129)\n- CVE-2017-5552: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a guest user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1021195).\n- CVE-2017-5578: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a guest user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1021481).\n- CVE-2017-5526: The ES1370 audio device emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1020589).\n- CVE-2017-5525: The ac97 audio device emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1020491).\n- CVE-2017-5667: The SDHCI device emulation support was vulnerable to an OOB heap access issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1022541).\n- CVE-2017-5898: The CCID Card device emulator support was vulnerable to an integer overflow allowing a privileged user inside the guest to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS (bnc#1023907)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Fix name of s390x specific sysctl configuration file to end with .conf (bsc#1026583)\n- XHCI fixes (bsc#977027)\n- Fixed rare race during s390x guest reboot\n- Fixed various inaccuracies in cirrus vga device emulation\n- Fixed cause of infrequent migration failures from bad virtio device state (bsc#1020928)\n- Fixed graphical update errors introduced by previous security fix (bsc#1016779)\n",
