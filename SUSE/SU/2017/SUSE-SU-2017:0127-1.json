	"summary": "Security update for qemu",
	"details": "\nqemu was updated to fix several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2016-9102: Memory leak in the v9fs_xattrcreate function in hw/9pfs/9p.c in allowed local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and QEMU process crash) via a large number of Txattrcreate messages with the same fid number (bsc#1014256).\n- CVE-2016-9103: The v9fs_xattrcreate function in hw/9pfs/9p.c in allowed local guest OS administrators to obtain sensitive host heap memory information by reading xattribute values writing to them (bsc#1007454).\n- CVE-2016-9381: Improper processing of shared rings allowing guest administrators take over the qemu process, elevating their privilege to that of the qemu process (bsc#1009109)\n- CVE-2016-9776: The ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller emulator support was vulnerable to an infinite loop issue while receiving packets in 'mcf_fec_receive'. A privileged user/process inside guest could have used this issue to crash the Qemu process on the host leading to DoS (bsc#1013285).\n- CVE-2016-9845: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support as vulnerable to an information leakage issue while processing the 'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET_INFO' command. A guest user/process could have used this flaw to leak contents of the host memory (bsc#1013767).\n- CVE-2016-9846: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue while updating the cursor data in update_cursor_data_virgl. A guest user/process could have used this flaw to leak host memory bytes, resulting in DoS for the host (bsc#1013764).\n- CVE-2016-9907: The USB redirector usb-guest support was vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw when destroying the USB redirector in 'usbredir_handle_destroy'.  A guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for a host (bsc#1014109).\n- CVE-2016-9908: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to an information leakage issue while processing the 'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET' command. A guest user/process could have used this flaw to leak contents of the host memory (bsc#1014514).\n- CVE-2016-9911: The USB EHCI Emulation support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue while processing packet data in 'ehci_init_transfer'. A guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for the host (bsc#1014111).\n- CVE-2016-9912: The Virtio GPU Device emulator support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue while destroying gpu resource object in 'virtio_gpu_resource_destroy'. A guest user/process could have used this flaw to leak host memory bytes, resulting in DoS for the host (bsc#1014112).\n- CVE-2016-9913: VirtFS was vulnerable to memory leakage issue via its '9p-handle' or '9p-proxy' backend drivers. A privileged user inside guest could have used this flaw to leak host memory, thus affecting other services on the host and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1014110).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Fixed uint64 property parsing and add regression tests (bsc#937125)\n- Added a man page for kvm_stat\n- Fix crash in vte (bsc#1008519)\n- Various upstream commits targeted towards stable releases (bsc#1013341)\n",
