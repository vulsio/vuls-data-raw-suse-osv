	"summary": "Security update for php7",
	"details": "\nThis update for php7 fixes the following security issues:\n\n- CVE-2016-7480: The SplObjectStorage unserialize implementation in\n  ext/spl/spl_observer.c in PHP did not verify that a key is an object,\n  which allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial\n  of service (uninitialized memory access) via crafted serialized data.\n  (bsc#1019568)\n- CVE-2017-5340: Zend/zend_hash.c in PHP mishandled certain cases that\n  require large array allocations, which allowed remote attackers to\n  execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer overflow,\n  uninitialized memory access, and use of arbitrary destructor function\n  pointers) via crafted serialized data. (bsc#1019570)\n- CVE-2016-7479: In all versions of PHP 7, during the unserialization\n  process, resizing the 'properties' hash table of a serialized object may\n  have lead to use-after-free. A remote attacker may exploit this bug to\n  gain arbitrary code execution. (bsc#1019547)\n- CVE-2016-7478: Zend/zend_exceptions.c in PHP allowed remote attackers to\n  cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted Exception object\n  in serialized data, a related issue to CVE-2015-8876.  (bsc#1019550)\n- CVE-2016-10159: Integer overflow in the phar_parse_pharfile function\n  in ext/phar/phar.c in PHP allowed remote attackers to cause a denial\n  of service (memory consumption or application crash) via a truncated\n  manifest entry in a PHAR archive. (bsc#1022255)\n- CVE-2016-10160: Off-by-one error in the phar_parse_pharfile function\n  in ext/phar/phar.c in PHP allowed remote attackers to cause a denial\n  of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via\n  a crafted PHAR archive with an alias mismatch. (bsc#1022257)\n- CVE-2016-10161: The object_common1 function in\n  ext/standard/var_unserializer.c in PHP allowed remote attackers to\n  cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via\n  crafted serialized data that is mishandled in a finish_nested_data call.\n  (bsc#1022260)\n- CVE-2016-10162: The php_wddx_pop_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in\n  PHP 7 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer\n  dereference and application crash) via an inapplicable class name in a\n  wddxPacket XML document, leading to mishandling in a wddx_deserialize\n  call. (bsc#1022262)\n- CVE-2016-10166: A potential unsigned underflow in gd interpolation\n  functions could lead to memory corruption in the PHP gd module\n  (bsc#1022263)\n- CVE-2016-10167: A denial of service problem in gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx()\n  could lead to php out of memory even on small files. (bsc#1022264)\n- CVE-2016-10168: A signed integer overflow in the gd module could lead\n  to memory corruption (bsc#1022265)\n- CVE-2016-9138: PHP mishandled property modification during __wakeup\n  processing, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted\n  serialized data, as demonstrated by Exception::__toString with\n  DateInterval::__wakeup.
