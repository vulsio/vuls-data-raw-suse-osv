	"summary": "Security update for Linux Kernel Live Patch 8 for SLE 12 SP2",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.4.59-92_20 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-7533: A bug in inotify code allowed local users to escalate privilege (bsc#1050751).\n- CVE-2017-8797: The NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the layout type when processing the NFSv4 pNFS GETDEVICEINFO or LAYOUTGET operand in a UDP packet from a remote attacker. This type value is uninitialized upon encountering certain error conditions. This value is used as an array index for dereferencing, which leads to an OOPS and eventually a DoS of knfsd and a soft-lockup of the whole system (bsc#1046202)\n- CVE-2017-7645: The NFSv2/NFSv3 server in the nfsd subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a long RPC reply, related to net/sunrpc/svc.c, fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c, and fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c (bsc#1046191).\n- CVE-2017-9242: The __ip6_append_data function in net/ipv6/ip6_output.c in the Linux kernel is too late in checking whether an overwrite of an skb data structure may occur, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted system calls (bsc#1042892).\n- CVE-2017-9077: The tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock function in net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to CVE-2017-8890 (bsc#1042364).\n- CVE-2017-8890: The inet_csk_clone_lock function in net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c in the Linux kernel allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of the accept system call (bsc#1038564).\n\nThe following non-security bug was fixed:\n\n- Fix for a btrfs deadlock between btrfs-cleaner and user space thread regression, which could cause spurious WARN_ON's from fs/btrfs/qgroup.c:1445 during patch application if BTRFS quota groups are enabled.
