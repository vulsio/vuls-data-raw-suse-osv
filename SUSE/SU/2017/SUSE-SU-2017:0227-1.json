	"summary": "Security update for Linux Kernel Live Patch 0 for SLE 12 SP2",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.4.21-69 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n- CVE-2016-10088: The sg implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict write operations in situations where the KERNEL_DS option is set, which allowed local users to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging access to a /dev/sg device, related to block/bsg.c and drivers/scsi/sg.c. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9576 (bsc#1019079).\n- CVE-2016-9794: Race condition in the snd_pcm_period_elapsed function in sound/core/pcm_lib.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_START command (bsc#1013543).\n- CVE-2016-8632: The tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel did not validate the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size, which allowed local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (bsc#1012852).\n- CVE-2016-9576: The blk_rq_map_user_iov function in block/blk-map.c in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which allowed local users to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging access to a /dev/sg device (bsc#1014271).\nbefore 4.8.14\n",
