	"summary": "Security update for wireshark",
	"details": "\nWireshark was updated to version 2.0.12, which brings several new features, enhancements\nand bug fixes.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-7700: In Wireshark the NetScaler file parser could go into an infinite loop, triggered by a malformed capture file. This was addressed in wiretap/netscaler.c by ensuring a nonzero record size (bsc#1033936).\n- CVE-2017-7701: In Wireshark the BGP dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bgp.c by using a different integer data type (bsc#1033937).\n- CVE-2017-7702: In Wireshark the WBXML dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding length validation (bsc#1033938).\n- CVE-2017-7703: In Wireshark the IMAP dissector could crash, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-imap.c by calculating a line's end correctly (bsc#1033939).\n- CVE-2017-7704: In Wireshark the DOF dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dof.c by using a different integer data type and adjusting a return value (bsc#1033940).\n- CVE-2017-7705: In Wireshark the RPC over RDMA dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-rpcrdma.c by correctly checking for going beyond the maximum offset (bsc#1033941).\n- CVE-2017-7745: In Wireshark the SIGCOMP dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-sigcomp.c by correcting a memory-size check (bsc#1033942).\n- CVE-2017-7746: In Wireshark the SLSK dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-slsk.c by adding checks for the remaining length (bsc#1033943).\n- CVE-2017-7747: In Wireshark the PacketBB dissector could crash, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-packetbb.c by restricting additions to the protocol tree (bsc#1033944).\n- CVE-2017-7748: In Wireshark the WSP dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wsp.c by adding a length check (bsc#1033945).\n- CVE-2016-7179: Stack-based buffer overflow in epan/dissectors/packet-catapult-dct2000.c in the Catapult DCT2000 dissector in Wireshark allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet (bsc#998963).\n- CVE-2016-9376: In Wireshark the OpenFlow dissector could crash with memory exhaustion, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-openflow_v5.c by ensuring that certain length values were sufficiently large (bsc#1010735).\n- CVE-2016-9375: In Wireshark the DTN dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dtn.c by checking whether SDNV evaluation was successful (bsc#1010740).\n- CVE-2016-9374: In Wireshark the AllJoyn dissector could crash with a buffer over-read, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-alljoyn.c by ensuring that a length variable properly tracked the state of a signature variable (bsc#1010752).\n- CVE-2016-9373: In Wireshark the DCERPC dissector could crash with a use-after-free, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcerpc-nt.c and epan/dissectors/packet-dcerpc-spoolss.c by using the wmem file scope for private strings (bsc#1010754).\n- CVE-2016-7175: epan/dissectors/packet-qnet6.c in the QNX6 QNET dissector in Wireshark mishandled MAC address data, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted packet (bsc#998761).\n- CVE-2016-7176: epan/dissectors/packet-h225.c in the H.225 dissector in Wireshark called snprintf with one of its input buffers as the output buffer, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (copy overlap and application crash) via a crafted packet (bsc#998762).\n- CVE-2016-7177: epan/dissectors/packet-catapult-dct2000.c in the Catapult DCT2000 dissector in Wireshark did not restrict the number of channels, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted packet (bsc#998763).\n- CVE-2016-7180: epan/dissectors/packet-ipmi-trace.c in the IPMI trace dissector in Wireshark did not properly consider whether a string is constant, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) via a crafted packet (bsc#998800).\n- CVE-2016-7178: epan/dissectors/packet-umts_fp.c in the UMTS FP dissector in Wireshark did not ensure that memory is allocated for certain data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write access and application crash) via a crafted packet (bsc#998964).\n- CVE-2017-6014: In Wireshark a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet size field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not advance, causing continuous attempts to read the same zero length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system memory (bsc#1025913).\n- CVE-2017-5596: In Wireshark the ASTERIX dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-asterix.c by changing a data type to avoid an integer overflow (bsc#1021739).\n- CVE-2017-5597: In Wireshark the DHCPv6 dissector could go into a large loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dhcpv6.c by changing a data type to avoid an integer overflow (bsc#1021739).\n",
