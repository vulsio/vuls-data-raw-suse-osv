	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.4.21-69 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-15274: security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel did not consider the case of a NULL payload in conjunction with a nonzero length value, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted add_key or keyctl system call (bsc#1062471).\n- CVE-2017-1000251: The native Bluetooth stack in the Linux Kernel (BlueZ) was vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability in the processing of L2CAP configuration responses resulting in Remote code execution in kernel space (bsc#1057950).\n- CVE-2017-12762: In drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c a user-controlled buffer was copied into a local buffer of constant size using strcpy without a length check which can cause a buffer overflow (bsc#1053150).\n",
