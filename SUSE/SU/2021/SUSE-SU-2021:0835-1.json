	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.4.180-94_138 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2020-27786: Fixed a potential user after free which could have led to memory corruption or privilege escalation (bsc#1179616).\n- CVE-2020-28374: Fixed insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code which could have been used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request (bsc#1178684).\n- CVE-2020-25645: Fixed an issue where the traffic between two Geneve endpoints may have been unencrypted when IPsec was configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted (bsc#1177513).\n- CVE-2020-0429: Fixed a potential memory corruption due to a use after free which could have led local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed (bsc#1176931).\n- CVE-2020-1749: Fixed an issue in some networking protocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6 where the kernel was not correctly routing tunneled data over the encrypted link rather sending the data unencrypted (bsc#1165631).\n",
