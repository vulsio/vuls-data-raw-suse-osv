	"summary": "Security update for the Linux Kernel (Live Patch 0 for SLE 15 SP3)",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 5.3.18-57 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2021-31440: Fixed a lack of proper validation of user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. (bsc#1190127).\n- CVE-2021-38160: Fixed a bug that could lead to a data corruption or loss. This can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size in drivers/char/virtio_console.c (bsc#1190118)\n- CVE-2021-3640: Fixed a user-after-free bug in the function sco_sock_sendmsg which could lead to local privilege escalation. (bsc#1188613)\n- CVE-2021-3573: Fixed a user-after-free bug in the function hci_sock_bound_ioctl which could lead to local privilege escalation. (bsc#1187054).\n",
