	"details": "This update for slurm fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdated to 20.11.7 \n\nSummary of new features:\n\n* CVE-2021-31215: Fixed a remote code execution as SlurmUser (bsc#1186024).\n* slurmd - handle configless failures gracefully instead of hanging indefinitely.\n* select/cons_tres - fix Dragonfly topology not selecting nodes in the same\n  leaf switch when it should as well as requests with *-switches option.\n* Fix issue where certain step requests wouldn't run if the first node in the\n  job allocation was full and there were idle resources on other nodes in\n  the job allocation.\n* Fix deadlock issue with <Prolog|Epilog>Slurmctld.\n* torque/qstat - fix printf error message in output.\n* When adding associations or wckeys avoid checking multiple times a user or cluster name.\n* Fix wrong jobacctgather information on a step on multiple nodes\n  due to timeouts sending its the information gathered on its node.\n* Fix missing xstrdup which could result in slurmctld segfault on array jobs.\n* Fix security issue in PrologSlurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld by always\n  prepending SPANK_ to all user-set environment variables. CVE-2021-31215.\n* Fix sacct assert with the --qos option.\n* Use pkg-config --atleast-version instead of --modversion for systemd.\n* common/fd - fix getsockopt() call in fd_get_socket_error().\n* Properly handle the return from fd_get_socket_error() in _conn_readable().\n* cons_res - Fix issue where running jobs were not taken into consideration\n  when creating a reservation.\n* Avoid a deadlock between job_list for_each and assoc QOS_LOCK.\n* Fix TRESRunMins usage for partition qos on restart/reconfig.\n* Fix printing of number of tasks on a completed job that didn't request tasks.\n* Fix updating GrpTRESRunMins when decrementing job time is bigger than it.\n* Make it so we handle multithreaded allocations correctly when doing\n  --exclusive or --core-spec allocations.\n* Fix incorrect round-up division in _pick_step_cores\n* Use appropriate math to adjust cpu counts when --ntasks-per-core=1.\n* cons_tres - Fix consideration of power downed nodes.\n* cons_tres - Fix DefCpuPerGPU, increase cpus-per-task to match with\n  gpus-per-task * cpus-per-gpu.\n* Fix under-cpu memory auto-adjustment when MaxMemPerCPU is set.\n* Make it possible to override CR_CORE_DEFAULT_DIST_BLOCK.\n* Perl API - fix retrieving/storing of slurm_step_id_t in job_step_info_t.\n* Recover state of burst buffers when slurmctld is restarted to avoid skipping\n  burst buffer stages.\n* Fix race condition in burst buffer plugin which caused a burst buffer\n  in stage-in to not get state saved if slurmctld stopped.\n* auth/jwt - print an error if jwt_file= has not been set in slurmdbd.\n* Fix RESV_DEL_HOLD not being a valid state when using squeue --states.\n* Add missing squeue selectable states in valid states error message.\n* Fix scheduling last array task multiple times on error, causing segfault.\n* Fix issue where a step could be allocated more memory than the job when\n  dealing with --mem-per-cpu and --threads-per-core.\n* Fix removing qos from assoc with -= can lead to assoc with no qos\n* auth/jwt - fix segfault on invalid credential in slurmdbd due to\n  missing validate_slurm_user() function in context.\n* Fix single Port= not being applied to range of nodes in slurm.conf\n* Fix Jobs not requesting a tres are not starting because of that tres limit.\n* acct_gather_energy/rapl - fix AveWatts calculation.\n* job_container/tmpfs - Fix issues with cleanup and slurmd restarting on\n  running jobs.\n",
