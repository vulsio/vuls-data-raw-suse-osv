	"summary": "Security update for apache2",
	"details": "This update for apache2 fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-17199: A bug in Apache's 'mod_session_cookie' lead to an issue where\n  the module did not respect a cookie's expiry time. [bsc#1122839]\n\n* CVE-2019-0220: The Apache HTTP server did not use a consistent strategy for\n  URL normalization throughout all of its components. In particular,\n  consecutive slashes were not always collapsed. Attackers could potentially\n  abuse these inconsistencies to by-pass access control mechanisms and thus\n  gain unauthorized access to protected parts of the service. [bsc#1131241]\n\n* CVE-2019-0217: A race condition in Apache's 'mod_auth_digest' when running in\n  a threaded server could have allowed users with valid credentials to\n  authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control\n  restrictions. [bsc#1131239]\n\n",
