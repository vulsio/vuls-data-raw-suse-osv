	"summary": "Security update for xen",
	"details": "This update for xen fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed: \n\n- CVE-2018-18849: Fixed an out of bounds memory access issue that was found in the LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter \n  emulation while writing a message in lsi_do_msgin. It could occur during migration if the 'msg_len' field has an invalid \n  value. A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS (bsc#1114423).\n- CVE-2018-19967: Fixed HLE constructs that allowed guests to lock up the host,\n  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). (XSA-282) (bsc#1114988)\n- CVE-2018-19665: Fixed an integer overflow in Bluetooth routines allows memory corruption (bsc#1117756).\n- CVE-2018-18438: Fixed an integer overflow in ccid_card_vscard_read function which allows memory corruption (bsc#1112188).\n- CVE-2018-17962: Fixed a Buffer Overflow in pcnet_receive in hw/net/pcnet.c because an incorrect integer data type is used (bsc#1111011).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious unprivileged guest userspace process to escalate its privilege \n  to that of other userspace processes in the same guest and potentially thereby to that \n  of the guest operating system (bsc#1126201).\n- CVE-2018-19961 CVE-2018-19962: Fixed insufficient TLB flushing / improper large page mappings with AMD IOMMUs (XSA-275)(bsc#1115040).\n- CVE-2018-17963: Fixed qemu_deliver_packet_iov in net/net.c that accepts packet sizes greater than INT_MAX, which allows attackers \n  to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact. (bsc#1111014)\n- Fixed an issue which could allow an untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device to DMA into its own \n  pagetables leading to privilege escalation (bsc#1126195).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service\n  attack affecting the whole system (bsc#1126196)\n- CVE-2018-17958: Fixed a Buffer Overflow in rtl8139_do_receive in hw/net/rtl8139.c because an incorrect integer data type is used (bsc#1111007).\n- CVE-2018-10839: Fixed an integer overflow which could lead to a buffer overflow issue (bsc#1110924).\n- CVE-2019-6778: Fixed a heap buffer overflow in tcp_emu() found in slirp (bsc#1123157).\n- CVE-2018-19966: Fixed issue introduced by XSA-240 that could have caused conflicts with shadow paging (XSA-280)(bsc#1115047).\n- CVE-2017-13672: Fixed an out of bounds read access during display update (bsc#1056336).\n- Fixed multiple access violations introduced by XENMEM_exchange hypercall which could allow\n  a single PV guest to leak arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a denial of service (bsc#1126192).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow malicious or buggy guests with passed through PCI devices to  be able to \n  escalate their privileges, crash the host, or access data belonging to other guests. Additionally memory \n  leaks were also possible (bsc#1126140).\n- Fixed a race condition issue which could allow malicious PV guests to escalate their privilege to that \n  of the hypervisor (bsc#1126141).\n- CVE-2019-9824: Fixed an information leak in SLiRP networking implementation which could allow a user/process \n  to read uninitialised stack memory contents (bsc#1129623).\n",
