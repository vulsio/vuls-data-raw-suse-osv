It will offer the installation of a 3rd party\n  add-on (Owl) which supports that protocol.\n* Thunderbird now compatible with other WebExtension-based FileLink add-ons\n  like the Dropbox add-on\n* New WebExtensions FileLink API to facilitate add-ons\n* Fix decoding problems for messages with less common charsets (cp932, cp936)\n* New messages in the drafts folder (and other special or virtual folders)\n  will no longer be included in the new messages notification\n* Thunderbird 60 will migrate security databases (key3.db, cert8.db to key4.db,\n  cert9.db).\n* Address book search and auto-complete slowness\n* Plain text markup with * for bold, / for italics, _ for underline and | for\n  code did not work when the enclosed text contained non-ASCII characters\n* While composing a message, a link not removed when link location was removed\n  in the link properties panel\n* Encoding problems when exporting address books or messages using the system\n  charset.

The SMTP LOGIN and POP3 USER/PASS\n  authentication methods are now using a Latin-1 encoding again\n  to work around this issue\n* Fix shutdown crash/hang after entering an empty IMAP password\n",
