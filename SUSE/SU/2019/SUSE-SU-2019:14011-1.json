	"summary": "Security update for xen",
	"details": "This update for xen fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed: \n\n- CVE-2018-19965: Fixed an issue related to the INVPCID instruction in case\n  non-canonical addresses are accessed, which may allow a guest to cause Xen to\n  crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.\n  (XSA-279) (bsc#1115045)\n- CVE-2018-18849: Fixed an out of bounds memory access issue was found in the \n  LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter emulation while writing a message in lsi_do_msgin (bsc#1114423).\n- CVE-2018-19665: Fixed an integer overflow resulting in memory corruption in\n  various Bluetooth functions, allowing this to crash qemu process resulting in\n  Denial of Service (DoS). (bsc#1117756).\n- CVE-2018-18438: Fixed an integer overflow in ccid_card_vscard_read function which could allow memory corruption (bsc#1112188).\n- CVE-2018-17962: Fixed an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in the\n  pcnet component (bsc#1111011)\n- CVE-2018-17963: Fixed an integer overflow in relation to large packet sizes,\n  leading to a denial of service (DoS). (bsc#1111014)\n- Fixed an issue which could allow an untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device to DMA into its own \n  pagetables leading to privilege escalation (bsc#1126195).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service\n  attack affecting the whole system (bsc#1126196).\n- CVE-2018-17958: Fixed an integer overflow  which could lead to buffer overflow (bsc#1111007).\n- CVE-2018-10839: Fixed an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in\n  the ne2000 component (bsc#1110924).\n- CVE-2019-6778: Fixed a heap buffer overflow in tcp_emu() found in slirp (bsc#1123157).\n- CVE-2018-19966: Fixed issue introduced by XSA-240 that could have caused conflicts with shadow paging (XSA-280)(bsc#1115047).\n- CVE-2018-19967: Fixed HLE constructs that allowed guests to lock up the host,\n  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). (XSA-282) (bsc#1114988).\n- Fixed multiple access violations introduced by XENMEM_exchange hypercall which could allow\n  a single PV guest to leak arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a denial of service (bsc#1126192).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow malicious or buggy guests with passed through PCI devices to  be able to \n  escalate their privileges, crash the host, or access data belonging to other guests. Additionally memory \n  leaks were also possible (bsc#1126140).\n- Fixed a race condition issue which could allow malicious PV guests to escalate their privilege to that \n  of the hypervisor (bsc#1126141).\n- CVE-2019-9824: Fixed an information leak in SLiRP networking implementation which could allow a user/process \n  to read uninitialised stack memory contents (bsc#1129623).\n",
