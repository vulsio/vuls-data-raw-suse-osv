	"summary": "Security update for python-numpy",
	"details": "This update for python-numpy fixes the following issues:\n\t  \nSecurity issue fixed:\n\n- CVE-2019-6446: Set allow_pickle to false by default to restrict loading untrusted content (bsc#1122208).\n  With this update we decrease the possibility of allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by\n  misusing numpy.load(). A warning during runtime will show-up when the allow_pickle is not explicitly set.\n  \nNOTE: By applying this update the behavior of python-numpy changes, which might break your application.\nIn order to get the old behaviour back, you have to explicitly set `allow_pickle` to True. Be aware\nthat this should only be done for trusted input, as loading untrusted input might lead to arbitrary code\nexecution.\n",
