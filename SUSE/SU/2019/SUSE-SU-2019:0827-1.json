	"summary": "Security update for xen",
	"details": "This update for xen fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2019-6778: Fixed a heap buffer overflow in tcp_emu() found in slirp (bsc#1123157).\n- CVE-2017-13672: Fixed an out of bounds read access during display update (bsc#1056336).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow malicious or buggy guests with passed through PCI devices to  be able to \n  escalate their privileges, crash the host, or access data belonging to other guests. Additionally memory \n  leaks were also possible (bsc#1126140)\n- Fixed a race condition issue which could allow malicious PV guests to escalate their privilege to that \n  of the hypervisor (bsc#1126141).\n- CVE-2018-18849: Fixed an out of bounds msg buffer access which could lead to denial of service (bsc#1114423).  \n- Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious unprivileged guest userspace process to escalate its privilege \n  to that of other userspace processes in the same guest and potentially thereby to that \n  of the guest operating system (bsc#1126201).  \n- CVE-2018-17958: Fixed an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in the\n  rtl8139 component (bsc#1111007)\n- CVE-2018-19967: Fixed HLE constructs that allowed guests to lock up the host,\n  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). (XSA-282) (bsc#1114988)  \n- CVE-2018-19665: Fixed an integer overflow resulting in memory corruption in\n  various Bluetooth functions, allowing this to crash qemu process resulting in\n  Denial of Service (DoS). (bsc#1117756).\n- CVE-2019-9824: Fixed an information leak in SLiRP networking implementation which could allow a user/process \n  to read uninitialised stack memory contents (bsc#1129623).\n- CVE-2018-19961, CVE-2018-19962: Fixed an issue related to insufficient TLB\n  flushing with AMD IOMMUs, which potentially allowed a guest to escalate its\n  privileges, may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or\n  may be able to access data it is not supposed to access. (XSA-275)\n  (bsc#1115040)\n- CVE-2018-19966: Fixed an issue related to a previous fix for XSA-240, which\n  conflicted with shadow paging and allowed a guest to cause Xen to crash,\n  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) (XSA-280) (bsc#1115047).\n- CVE-2018-10839: Fixed an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in\n  the ne2000 component (bsc#1110924).\n- CVE-2018-19965: Fixed an issue related to the INVPCID instruction in case\n  non-canonical addresses are accessed, which may allow a guest to cause Xen to\n  crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.\n  (XSA-279) (bsc#1115045).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow malicious 64bit PV guests to cause a host crash (bsc#1127400).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow malicious PV guests may cause a host crash or \n  gain access to data pertaining to other guests.Additionally, vulnerable configurations \n  are likely to be unstable even in the absence of an attack (bsc#1126198).\n- Fixed multiple access violations introduced by XENMEM_exchange hypercall which could allow \n  a single PV guest to leak arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a denial of service (bsc#1126192).\n- CVE-2018-17963: Fixed an integer overflow in relation to large packet sizes,\n  leading to a denial of service (DoS). (bsc#1111014).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service\n  attack affecting the whole system (bsc#1126196).\n- Fixed an issue which could allow an untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device to DMA into its own \n  pagetables leading to privilege escalation (bsc#1126195).\n- CVE-2018-17962: Fixed an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in the\n  pcnet component (bsc#1111011)\n- CVE-2018-18438: Fixed an integer overflow in ccid_card_vscard_read function which could lead to memory corruption (bsc#1112188).\n\nOther issues fixed: \n\n- Upstream bug fixes (bsc#1027519)\n- Fixed an issue where XEN SLE12-SP1 domU hangs on SLE12-SP3 HV1108940 (bsc#1108940).\n",
