	"summary": "Security update for systemd",
	"details": "This update for systemd fixes the following issues:\n\n* Fix security vulnerabilities CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865 (bsc#1120323):\n  Both issues were memory corruptions via attacker-controlled alloca which could\n  have been used to gain root privileges by a local attacker.\n\n* Fix security vulnerability CVE-2018-15686 (bsc#1113665): A vulnerability in\n  unit_deserialize of systemd used to allow an attacker to supply arbitrary\n  state across systemd re-execution via NotifyAccess. This could have been used\n  to improperly influence systemd execution and possibly lead to root privilege\n  escalation.\n\n* Remedy 2048 character line-length limit in systemd-sysctl code that would\n  cause parser failures if /etc/sysctl.conf contained lines that exceeded this\n  length (bsc#1071558).\n\n* Fix a bug in systemd's core timer code that would cause timer looping under\n  certain conditions, resulting in hundreds of syslog messages being written to\n  the journal (bsc#1068588).\n",
