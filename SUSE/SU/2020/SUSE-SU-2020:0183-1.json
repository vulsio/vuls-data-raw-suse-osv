	"summary": "Security update for the Linux Kernel (Live Patch 0 for SLE 12 SP5)",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.12.14-120 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2019-14896: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Marvell WiFi chip driver. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when the lbs_ibss_join_existing function is called after a STA connects to an AP (bsc#1157157).\n- CVE-2019-14897: A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the  Marvell WiFi chip driver. An attacker was able to cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when a STA works in IBSS mode (allows connecting stations together without the use of an AP) and connects to another STA (bsc#1157155).\n- CVE-2019-10220: The CIFS implementation was vulnerable to a relative paths injection in directory entry lists (bsc#1144903).\n- CVE-2019-17133: Fixed a Buffer Overflow in cfg80211_mgd_wext_giwessid() in net/wireless/wext-sme.c, because the function did not reject a long SSID IE (bsc#1153158).\n- CVE-2019-14835: A buffer overflow flaw was fixed in the vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host (bsc#1150112).\n- xen/pv: Fixed a boot up hang where domain_crash_sync was called from entry.S (bsc#1153811).\n",
