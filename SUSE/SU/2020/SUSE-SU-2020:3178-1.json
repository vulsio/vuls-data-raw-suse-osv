	"summary": "Security update for the Linux Kernel (Live Patch 20 for SLE 15)",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.12.14-150_58 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2020-14381: Fixed a use-after-free in the fast user mutex (futex) wait operation, which could have lead to memory corruption and possibly privilege escalation (bsc#1176011).\n- CVE-2020-0431: In kbd_keycode of keyboard.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. (bsc#1176722)\n- CVE-2020-25212: A TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory or possibly have unspecified other impact because a size check is in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c instead of fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c (bsc#1176381).\n- CVE-2020-11668: Fixed an out of bounds write to the heap in drivers/media/usb/gspca/xirlink_cit.c (aka the Xirlink camera USB driver) caused by mishandling invalid descriptors (bsc#1168952).\n",
