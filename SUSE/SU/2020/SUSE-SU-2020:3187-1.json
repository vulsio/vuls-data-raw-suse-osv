	"summary": "Security update for the Linux Kernel (Live Patch 0 for SLE 15 SP2)",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 5.3.18-22 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2020-25212: A TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory or possibly have unspecified other impact because a size check is in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c instead of fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c (bsc#1176381).\n- CVE-2020-14386: Fixed a memory corruption which could have lead to an attacker gaining root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity (bsc#1176069).\n- CVE-2020-24394: The NFS server code can set incorrect permissions on new filesystem objects when the filesystem lacks ACL support. This occurs because the current umask is not considered (bsc#1175518).\n",
