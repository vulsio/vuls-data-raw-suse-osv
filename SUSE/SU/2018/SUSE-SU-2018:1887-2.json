	"summary": "Security update for openssl",
	"details": "This update for openssl fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-0732: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based\n  ciphersuite a malicious server could have sent a very large prime value to the\n  client. This caused the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time\n  generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has\n  finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack (bsc#1097158).\n- Blinding enhancements for ECDSA and DSA (bsc#1097624, bsc#1098592)\n",
