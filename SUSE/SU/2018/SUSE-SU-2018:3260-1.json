	"summary": "Security update for fuse",
	"details": "This update for fuse fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-10906: fusermount was vulnerable to a restriction bypass when\n  SELinux is active. This allowed non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with\n  the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set\n  in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file\n  system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that\n  file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects\n  (bsc#1101797)\n",
