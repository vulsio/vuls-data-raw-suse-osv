	"details": "This update for enigmail to 2.0.7 fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-12020: Mitigation against GnuPG signature spoofing:\n  Email signatures could be spoofed via an embedded '--filename'\n  parameter in OpenPGP literal data packets. This update prevents\n  this issue from being exploited if GnuPG was not updated\n  (boo#1096745)\n- CVE-2018-12019: The signature verification routine interpreted\n  User IDs as status/control messages and did not correctly keep\n  track of the status of multiple signatures. This allowed remote\n  attackers to spoof arbitrary email signatures via public keys\n  containing crafted primary user ids (boo#1097525)\n- Disallow plaintext (literal packets) outside of encrpyted packets\n- Replies to a partially encrypted message may have revealed\n  protected information - no longer display PGP/MIME message\n  part followed by unencrypted data (bsc#1094781)\n- Fix signature Spoofing via Inline-PGP in HTML Mails\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Fix filter actions forgetting selected mail folder names\n- Fix compatibility issue with Thunderbird 60b7\n",
