	"details": "This update for tiff fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-17100: There is a int32 overflow in multiply_ms in tools/ppm2tiff.c, which can cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file. (bsc#1108637)\n- CVE-2018-17101: There are two out-of-bounds writes in cpTags in tools/tiff2bw.c and tools/pal2rgb.c, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file. (bsc#1108627)\n- CVE-2018-17795: The function t2p_write_pdf in tiff2pdf.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9935. (bsc#1110358)\n- CVE-2018-16335: newoffsets handling in ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip in tif_dirread.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, as demonstrated by tiff2pdf. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-15209. (bsc#1106853)\n\n",
