	"summary": "Security update for rpm",
	"details": "This update for rpm fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-7500: rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a\n  destination path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing\n  ownership and permissions of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed\n  in an arbitrary destination (bsc#943457).\n- CVE-2017-7501: rpm used temporary files with predictable names when\n  installing an RPM. An attacker with ability to write in a directory where files\n  will be installed could create symbolic links to an arbitrary location and\n  modify content, and possibly permissions to arbitrary files, which could be\n  used for denial of service or possibly privilege escalation (bsc#943457)\n\nThis is a reissue of the above security fixes for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 GA, SP1 and SP2 LTSS,\nthey have already been released for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3.\n\n",
