	"details": "This update for ansible fixes the following issues:\n\nAnsible was updated to ansible 2.4.6.0.\n\nThe full release notes can be found on:\n\n\thttps://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.4/CHANGELOG.md\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-10875: ansible.cfg is read from the current working directory which can be altered to make it point to a plugin or a module path under the control of an attacker, thus allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code. (bsc#1099808)\n- CVE-2018-10874: It was found that inventory variables are loaded from current working directory when running ad-hoc command which are under attacker's control, allowing to run arbitrary code as a result. (bsc#1099805)\n- CVE-2018-10855: Ansible did not honor the no_log task flag for failed tasks. When the no_log flag has been used to protect sensitive data passed to a task from being logged, and that task does not run successfully, Ansible will expose sensitive data in log files and on the terminal of the user running Ansible.
