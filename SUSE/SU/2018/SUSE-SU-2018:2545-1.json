	"summary": "Security update for openssl1",
	"details": "This update for openssl1 fixes the following security issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-0737: The RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be\n  vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient\n  access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process\n  could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)\n- CVE-2018-0732: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based\n  ciphersuite a malicious server could have sent a very large prime value to the\n  client. This caused the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time\n  generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has\n  finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack (bsc#1097158)\n- Blinding enhancements for ECDSA and DSA (bsc#1097624, bsc#1098592)\n",
