	"summary": "Security update for icu",
	"details": "This update for icu fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2016-6293: The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp did not ensure that there is a '\\0' character at the end of a certain temporary array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument. (bsc#990636)\n- CVE-2017-7868: ICU had an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow related to the utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and the utext_moveIndex32* function. (bsc#1034674)\n- CVE-2017-7867: ICU had an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow related to the utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and the utext_setNativeIndex* function. (bsc#1034678)\n- CVE-2017-14952: Double free in i18n/zonemeta.cpp allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted string, aka a 'redundant UVector entry clean up function call' issue. (bsc#1067203)\n- CVE-2017-17484:The ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8 function in ucnv_u8.cpp mishandled ucnv_convertEx calls for UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated by ZNC. (bsc#1072193)\n- CVE-2017-15422: An integer overflow in persian calendar calculation was fixed, which could show wrong years. (bsc#1077999)\n",
