	"summary": "Security update for openssl-1_0_0",
	"details": "This update for openssl-1_0_0 to 1.0.2p fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- Prevent One&Done side-channel attack on RSA that allowed physically near\n  attackers to use EM emanations to recover information (bsc#1104789)\n- CVE-2018-0737: The RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be\n  vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient\n  access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process\n  could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)\n- CVE-2018-0732: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based\n  ciphersuite a malicious server could have sent a very large prime value to the\n  client. This caused the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time\n  generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has\n  finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack (bsc#1097158)\n- Make problematic ECDSA sign addition length-invariant\n- Add blinding to ECDSA and DSA signatures to protect against side channel attacks\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n\n- Add openssl(cli) Provide so the packages that require the openssl\n  binary can require this instead of the new openssl meta package\n  (bsc#1101470)\n",
