	"summary": "Security update for ghostscript",
	"details": "This update for ghostscript to version 9.25 fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-17183: Remote attackers were be able to supply crafted PostScript to\n  potentially overwrite or replace error handlers to inject code (bsc#1109105)\n- CVE-2018-15909: Prevent type confusion using the .shfill operator that could\n  have been used by attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files to crash\n  the interpreter or potentially execute code (bsc#1106172).\n- CVE-2018-15908: Prevent attackers that are able to supply malicious\n  PostScript files to bypass .tempfile restrictions and write files\n  (bsc#1106171).\n- CVE-2018-15910: Prevent a type confusion in the LockDistillerParams parameter\n  that could have been used to crash the interpreter or execute code\n  (bsc#1106173).\n- CVE-2018-15911: Prevent use uninitialized memory access in the aesdecode\n  operator that could have been used to crash the interpreter or potentially\n  execute code (bsc#1106195).\n- CVE-2018-16513: Prevent a type confusion in the setcolor function that could\n  have been used to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other\n  impact (bsc#1107412).\n- CVE-2018-16509: Incorrect 'restoration of privilege' checking during handling\n  of /invalidaccess exceptions could be have been used by attackers able to\n  supply crafted PostScript to execute code using the 'pipe' instruction\n  (bsc#1107410).\n- CVE-2018-16510: Incorrect exec stack handling in the 'CS' and 'SC' PDF\n  primitives could have been used by remote attackers able to supply crafted PDFs\n  to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact\n  (bsc#1107411).\n- CVE-2018-16542: Prevent attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files\n  from using insufficient interpreter stack-size checking during error handling\n  to crash the interpreter (bsc#1107413).\n- CVE-2018-16541: Prevent attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files\n  from using incorrect free logic in pagedevice replacement to crash the\n  interpreter (bsc#1107421).\n- CVE-2018-16540: Prevent use-after-free in copydevice handling that could have\n  been used to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact\n  (bsc#1107420).\n- CVE-2018-16539: Prevent attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files\n  from using incorrect access checking in temp file handling to disclose contents\n  of files on the system otherwise not readable (bsc#1107422).\n- CVE-2018-16543: gssetresolution and gsgetresolution allowed attackers to have\n  an unspecified impact (bsc#1107423).\n- CVE-2018-16511: A type confusion in 'ztype' could have been used by remote\n  attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or\n  possibly have unspecified other impact (bsc#1107426).\n- CVE-2018-16585: The .setdistillerkeys PostScript command was accepted even\n  though it is not intended for use during document processing (e.g., after the\n  startup phase). This lead to memory corruption, allowing remote attackers able\n  to supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or possibly have\n  unspecified other impact (bsc#1107581).\n- CVE-2018-16802: Incorrect 'restoration of privilege' checking when running\n  out of stack during exception handling could have been used by attackers able\n  to supply crafted PostScript to execute code using the 'pipe' instruction. This\n  is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509 (bsc#1108027).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n* Fixes problems with argument handling, some unintended results of the\n  security fixes to the SAFER file access restrictions (specifically accessing\n  ICC profile files).\n* Avoid that ps2epsi fails with 'Error: /undefined in --setpagedevice--'\n\nFor additional changes please check http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.25/News.htm\nand the changes file of the package.\n  ",
