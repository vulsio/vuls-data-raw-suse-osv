	"summary": "Security update for tomcat",
	"details": "This update for tomcat to version 8.0.53 fixes the following security issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-11784: When the default servlet in Apache Tomcat returned\n  a redirect to a directory (e.g. redirecting to '/foo/' when the user\n  requested '/foo') a specially crafted URL could be used to cause the\n  redirect to be generated to any URI of the attackers choice. (bsc#1110850)\n- CVE-2018-1336: An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with\n  supplementary characters could have lead to an infinite loop in the decoder\n  causing a Denial of Service (bsc#1102400)\n- CVE-2018-8034: The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket\n  client was missing. It is now enabled by default (bsc#1102379)\n- CVE-2018-8037: If an async request was completed by the application at the\n  same time as the container triggered the async timeout, a race condition\n  existed that could have resulted in a user seeing a response intended for a\n  different user. An additional issue was present in the NIO and NIO2 connectors\n  that did not correctly track the closure of the connection when an async\n  request was completed by the application and timed out by the container at the\n  same time. This could also have resulted in a user seeing a response intended\n  for another user (bsc#1102410)\n- CVE-2018-1305: Fixed late application of security constraints that can lead\n  to resource exposure for unauthorised users (bsc#1082481).\n- CVE-2018-1304: Fixed incorrect handling of empty string URL in security\n  constraints that can lead to unitended exposure of resources (bsc#1082480).\n- CVE-2017-15706: Fixed incorrect documentation of CGI Servlet search algorithm\n  that may lead to misconfiguration (bsc#1078677).\n- CVE-2018-8014: The defaults settings for the CORS filter were insecure and\n  enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins (bsc#1093697).\n",
