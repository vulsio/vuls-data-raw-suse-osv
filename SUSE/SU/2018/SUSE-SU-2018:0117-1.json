	"details": "This update for rsync fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-17434: The daemon in rsync did not check for fnamecmp filenames in\n  the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in\n  receiver.c) and also did not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to\n  pathnames found in 'xname follows' strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function\n  in rsync.c), which allowed remote attackers to bypass intended access\n  restrictions' (bsc#1071460).\n- CVE-2017-17433: The recv_files function in receiver.c in the daemon in rsync,\n  proceeded with certain file metadata updates before checking for a filename in\n  the daemon_filter_list data structure, which allowed remote attackers to bypass\n  intended access restrictions (bsc#1071459).\n- CVE-2017-16548: The receive_xattr function in xattrs.c in rsync did not check\n  for a trailing '\\\\0' character in an xattr name, which allowed remote attackers\n  to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application\n  crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending crafted data to the\n  daemon (bsc#1066644).\n",
