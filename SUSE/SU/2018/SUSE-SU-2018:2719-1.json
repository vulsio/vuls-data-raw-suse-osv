	"details": "This update for openssh-openssl1 fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2016-10708: Prevent NULL pointer dereference via an out-of-sequence\n  NEWKEYS message allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n  (bsc#1076957).\n- CVE-2017-15906: The process_open function did not properly prevent write\n  operations in readonly mode, which allowed attackers to create zero-length\n  files (bsc#1065000).\n- CVE-2016-10012: The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication\n  compression) did not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers,\n  which might have allowed local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to\n  a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib\n  data structures (bsc#1016370).\n- CVE-2008-1483: Prevent local users from hijacking forwarded X connections by\n  causing ssh to set DISPLAY to :10, even when another process is listening on\n  the associated port. This problem was reontroduced by another patch and was\n  previously fixed by another update (bsc#1069509).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Remove duplicate KEX method (bsc#1053972)\n- New switch for printing diagnostic messages in sftp client's batch mode (bsc#1023275)\n- Enable case-insensitive hostname matching (bsc#1017099)\n",
