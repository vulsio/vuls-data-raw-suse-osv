	"summary": "Security update for icu",
	"details": "icu was updated to fix two security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2014-8147: The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c\n  in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in\n  International Components for Unicode (ICU) used an integer data type\n  that is inconsistent with a header file, which allowed remote attackers\n  to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc followed by invalid free)\n  or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text (bsc#929629).\n- CVE-2014-8146: The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c\n  in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in\n  International Components for Unicode (ICU) did not properly track\n  directionally isolated pieces of text, which allowed remote attackers\n  to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly\n  execute arbitrary code via crafted text (bsc#929629).\n- CVE-2016-6293: The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in\n  common/uloc.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++\n  did not ensure that there is a '\\0' character at the end of a certain\n  temporary array, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact\n  via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument (bsc#990636).\n- CVE-2017-7868: International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++\n  2017-02-13 has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer\n  overflow related to the utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and\n  the utext_moveIndex32* function (bsc#1034674)\n- CVE-2017-7867: International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++\n  2017-02-13 has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer\n  overflow related to the utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and\n  the utext_setNativeIndex* function (bsc#1034678)\n- CVE-2017-14952: Double free in i18n/zonemeta.cpp in International\n  Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ allowed remote attackers to\n  execute arbitrary code via a crafted string, aka a 'redundant UVector\n  entry clean up function call' issue (bnc#1067203)\n- CVE-2017-17484: The ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8 function in ucnv_u8.cpp\n  in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ mishandled\n  ucnv_convertEx calls for UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion, which allowed remote\n  attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow\n  and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a\n  crafted string, as demonstrated by ZNC  (bnc#1072193)\n- CVE-2017-15422: An integer overflow in icu during persian calendar\n  date processing could lead to incorrect years shown (bnc#1077999)\n\n",
