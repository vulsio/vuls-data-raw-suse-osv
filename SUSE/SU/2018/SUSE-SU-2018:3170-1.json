	"details": "This update for binutils to version 2.31 fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-15996: readelf allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n  (excessive memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a\n  crafted ELF file that triggered a buffer overflow on fuzzed archive header\n  (bsc#1065643)\n- CVE-2017-15939: Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) mishandled\n  NULL files in a .debug_line file table, which allowed remote attackers to cause\n  a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a\n  crafted ELF file, related to concat_filename (bsc#1065689)\n- CVE-2017-15938: the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd)\n  miscalculated DW_FORM_ref_addr die refs in the case of a relocatable object\n  file, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n  (find_abstract_instance_name invalid memory read, segmentation fault, and\n   application crash) (bsc#1065693)\n- CVE-2017-16826: The coff_slurp_line_table function the Binary File Descriptor\n  (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service (invalid memory access and application crash) or possibly have\n  unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file (bsc#1068640)\n- CVE-2017-16832: The pe_bfd_read_buildid function in the Binary File\n  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did not validate size and offset values\n  in the data dictionary, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service (segmentation violation and application crash) or possibly have\n  unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file (bsc#1068643)\n- CVE-2017-16831: Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did not\n  validate the symbol count, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service (integer overflow and application crash, or excessive memory\n  allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file\n  (bsc#1068887)\n- CVE-2017-16830: The print_gnu_property_note function did not have\n  integer-overflow protection on 32-bit platforms, which allowed remote attackers\n  to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation and application crash) or\n  possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file (bsc#1068888)\n- CVE-2017-16829: The _bfd_elf_parse_gnu_properties function in the Binary File\n  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did not prevent negative pointers, which\n  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and\n  application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF\n  file (bsc#1068950)\n- CVE-2017-16828: The display_debug_frames function allowed remote attackers to\n  cause a denial of service (integer overflow and heap-based buffer over-read,\n  and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted\n  ELF file (bsc#1069176)\n- CVE-2017-16827: The aout_get_external_symbols function in the Binary File\n  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a\n  denial of service (slurp_symtab invalid free and application crash) or possibly\n  have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file (bsc#1069202)\n- CVE-2018-6323: The elf_object_p function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)\n  library (aka libbfd) had an unsigned integer overflow because bfd_size_type\n  multiplication is not used. A crafted ELF file allowed remote attackers to\n  cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified\n  other impact (bsc#1077745)\n- CVE-2018-6543: Prevent integer overflow in the function\n  load_specific_debug_section() which resulted in `malloc()` with 0 size. A\n  crafted ELF file allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n  (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact (bsc#1079103)\n- CVE-2018-6759: The bfd_get_debug_link_info_1 function in the Binary File\n  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) had an unchecked strnlen operation.\n  Remote attackers could have leveraged this vulnerability to cause a denial of\n  service (segmentation fault) via a crafted ELF file (bsc#1079741)\n- CVE-2018-6872: The elf_parse_notes function in the Binary File Descriptor\n  (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service (out-of-bounds read and segmentation violation) via a note with a large\n  alignment (bsc#1080556)\n- CVE-2018-7208: In the coff_pointerize_aux function in the Binary File\n  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) an index was not validated, which allowed\n  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly\n  have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy of\n  a COFF object (bsc#1081527)\n- CVE-2018-7570: The assign_file_positions_for_non_load_sections function in\n  the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers\n  to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash)\n  via an ELF file with a RELRO segment that lacks a matching LOAD segment, as\n  demonstrated by objcopy (bsc#1083528)\n- CVE-2018-7569: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed\n  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer underflow or overflow,\n  and application crash) via an ELF file with a corrupt DWARF FORM block, as\n  demonstrated by nm (bsc#1083532)\n- CVE-2018-8945: The bfd_section_from_shdr function in the Binary File\n  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a\n  denial of service (segmentation fault) via a large attribute section\n  (bsc#1086608)\n- CVE-2018-7643: The display_debug_ranges function allowed remote attackers to\n  cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly\n  have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by\n  objdump (bsc#1086784)\n- CVE-2018-7642: The swap_std_reloc_in function in the Binary File Descriptor\n  (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service (aout_32_swap_std_reloc_out NULL pointer dereference and application\n  crash) via a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by objcopy (bsc#1086786)\n- CVE-2018-7568: The parse_die function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)\n  library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n  (integer overflow and application crash) via an ELF file with corrupt dwarf1\n  debug information, as demonstrated by nm (bsc#1086788)\n- CVE-2018-10373: concat_filename in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library\n  (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL\n  pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted binary file, as\n  demonstrated by nm-new (bsc#1090997)\n- CVE-2018-10372: process_cu_tu_index allowed remote attackers to cause a\n  denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a\n  crafted binary file, as demonstrated by readelf (bsc#1091015)\n- CVE-2018-10535: The ignore_section_sym function in the Binary File Descriptor\n  (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did not validate the output_section pointer in the\n  case of a symtab entry with a 'SECTION' type that has a '0' value, which\n  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference\n  and application crash) via a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy\n  (bsc#1091365)\n- CVE-2018-10534: The _bfd_XX_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common function in the\n  Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) processesed a negative Data\n  Directory size with an unbounded loop that increased the value of\n  (external_IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY) *edd so that the address exceeded its own\n  memory region, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory write, as demonstrated by\n  objcopy copying private info with _bfd_pex64_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common\n  in pex64igen.c (bsc#1091368)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- The AArch64 port now supports showing disassembly notes which are emitted\n  when inconsistencies are found with the instruction that may result in the\n  instruction being invalid.  These can be turned on with the option -M notes\n  to objdump.\n- The AArch64 port now emits warnings when a combination of an instruction and\n  a named register could be invalid.\n- Added O modifier to ar to display member offsets inside an archive\n- The ADR and ADRL pseudo-instructions supported by the ARM assembler\n  now only set the bottom bit of the address of thumb function symbols\n  if the -mthumb-interwork command line option is active.\n- Add --generate-missing-build-notes=[yes|no] option to create (or not) GNU\n  Build Attribute notes if none are present in the input sources.  Add a\n  --enable-generate-build-notes=[yes|no] configure time option to set the\n  default behaviour.  Set the default if the configure option is not used\n  to 'no'.\n- Remove -mold-gcc command-line option for x86 targets.\n- Add -O[2|s] command-line options to x86 assembler to enable alternate\n  shorter instruction encoding.\n- Add support for .nops directive.  It is currently supported only for\n  x86 targets.\n- Speed up direct linking with DLLs for Cygwin and Mingw targets.\n- Add a configure option --enable-separate-code to decide whether\n  -z separate-code should be enabled in ELF linker by default.  Default\n  to yes for Linux/x86 targets.  Note that -z separate-code can increase\n  disk and memory size.\n- RISC-V: Fix symbol address problem with versioned symbols \n- Restore riscv64-elf cross prefix via symlinks\n- Fix pacemaker libqb problem with section start/stop symbols\n- RISC-V: Don't enable relaxation in relocatable link\n- Prevent linking faiures on i386 with assertion (bsc#1085784)\n- Fix symbol size bug when relaxation deletes bytes\n- Add --debug-dump=links option to readelf and --dwarf=links option to objdump\n  which displays the contents of any .gnu_debuglink or .gnu_debugaltlink\n  sections.\n  Add a --debug-dump=follow-links option to readelf and a --dwarf=follow-links\n  option to objdump which causes indirect links into separate debug info files\n  to be followed when dumping other DWARF sections.\n- Add support for loaction views in DWARF debug line information.\n- Add -z separate-code to generate separate code PT_LOAD segment.\n- Add '-z undefs' command line option as the inverse of the '-z defs' option.\n- Add -z globalaudit command line option to force audit libraries to be run\n  for every dynamic object loaded by an executable - provided that the loader\n  supports this functionality.\n- Tighten linker script grammar around file name specifiers to prevent the use\n  of SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT and SORT_BY_INIT_PRIORITY on filenames.  These would\n  previously be accepted but had no effect.\n- The EXCLUDE_FILE directive can now be placed within any SORT_* directive\n  within input section lists.\n- Fix linker relaxation with --wrap\n",
