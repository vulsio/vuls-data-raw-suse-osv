	"summary": "Security update for tomcat6",
	"details": "This update for tomcat6 fixes the following security issues:\n\n- : The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification\n  requires that, when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the\n  error that occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the\n  error page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the\n  original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is\n  to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the\n  actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Tomcat did not do this. Depending on\n  the original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for\n  static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit\n  writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page (bsc#1042910).\n- : The URL pattern of '' was not correctly handled when used as\n  part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be\n  ignored. It was possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web\n  application resources that should have been protected. Only security\n  constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected (bsc#1082480).\n",
