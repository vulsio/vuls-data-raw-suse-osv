	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.61-52_119 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-3646: Local attackers in virtualized guest systems could use speculative code patterns on hyperthreaded processors to read data present in the L1 Datacache used by other hyperthreads on the same CPU core, potentially leaking sensitive data, even from other virtual machines or the host system (bsc#1099306).\n- CVE-2018-10853: A flaw was found in kvm. In which certain instructions such as sgdt/sidt call segmented_write_std didn't propagate access correctly. As such, during userspace induced exception, the guest can incorrectly assume that the exception happened in the kernel and panic. (bsc#1097108).\n",
