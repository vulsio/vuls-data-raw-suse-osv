	"summary": "Security update for tiff",
	"details": "This update for tiff fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2016-5315: The setByteArray function in tif_dir.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted tiff image.  (bsc#984809)\n- CVE-2016-10267: LibTIFF allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted TIFF image, related to libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c:816:8.  (bsc#1017694)\n- CVE-2016-10269: LibTIFF allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF image, related to 'READ of size 512' and libtiff/tif_unix.c:340:2.  (bsc#1031254)\n- CVE-2016-10270: LibTIFF allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF image, related to 'READ of size 8' and libtiff/tif_read.c:523:22.  (bsc#1031250)\n- CVE-2017-18013: In LibTIFF, there was a Null-Pointer Dereference in the tif_print.c TIFFPrintDirectory function, as demonstrated by a tiffinfo crash.  (bsc#1074317)\n- CVE-2017-7593: tif_read.c did not ensure that tif_rawdata is properly initialized, which might have allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033129)\n- CVE-2017-7595: The JPEGSetupEncode function in tiff_jpeg.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033127)\n- CVE-2017-7596: LibTIFF had an 'outside the range of representable values of type float' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033126)\n- CVE-2017-7597: tif_dirread.c had an 'outside the range of representable values of type float' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033120)\n- CVE-2017-7599: LibTIFF had an 'outside the range of representable values of type short' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033113)\n- CVE-2017-7600: LibTIFF had an 'outside the range of representable values of type unsigned char' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033112)\n- CVE-2017-7601: LibTIFF had a 'shift exponent too large for 64-bit type long' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033111)\n- CVE-2017-7602: LibTIFF had a signed integer overflow, which might have allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.  (bsc#1033109)\n- Multiple divide by zero issues\n- CVE-2016-5314: Buffer overflow in the PixarLogDecode function in tif_pixarlog.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF image, as demonstrated by overwriting the vgetparent function pointer with rgb2ycbcr.  (bsc#987351 bsc#984808 bsc#984831)\n",
