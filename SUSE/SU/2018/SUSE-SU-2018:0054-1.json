	"summary": "Security update for wireshark",
	"details": "\n  \nThis update for wireshark to version 2.2.11 fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-13767: The MSDP dissector could have gone into an infinite loop.\n  This was addressed by adding length validation (bsc#1056248)\n- CVE-2017-13766: The Profinet I/O dissector could have crash with an\n  out-of-bounds write. This was addressed by adding string validation\n  (bsc#1056249)\n- CVE-2017-13765: The IrCOMM dissector had a buffer over-read and application\n  crash. This was addressed by adding length validation (bsc#1056251)\n- CVE-2017-9766: PROFINET IO data with a high recursion depth allowed remote\n  attackers to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion) in the\n  dissect_IODWriteReq function (bsc#1045341)\n- CVE-2017-9617: Deeply nested DAAP data may have cause stack exhaustion\n  (uncontrolled recursion) in the dissect_daap_one_tag function in the DAAP\n  dissector (bsc#1044417)\n- CVE-2017-15192: The BT ATT dissector could crash. This was addressed\n  in epan/dissectors/packet-btatt.c by considering a case where not all\n  of the BTATT packets have the same encapsulation level. (bsc#1062645)\n- CVE-2017-15193: The MBIM dissector could crash or exhaust system\n  memory. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mbim.c by changing\n  the memory-allocation approach. (bsc#1062645)\n- CVE-2017-15191: The DMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in\n  epan/dissectors/packet-dmp.c by validating a string length. (bsc#1062645)\n- CVE-2017-17083: NetBIOS dissector could crash. This was addressed in\n  epan/dissectors/packet-netbios.c by ensuring that write operations are\n  bounded by the beginning of a buffer. (bsc#1070727)\n- CVE-2017-17084: IWARP_MPA dissector could crash. This was addressed\n  in epan/dissectors/packet-iwarp-mpa.c by validating a ULPDU\n  length. (bsc#1070727)\n- CVE-2017-17085: the CIP Safety dissector could crash. This was\n  addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-cipsafety.c by validating the packet\n  length. (bsc#1070727)\n",
