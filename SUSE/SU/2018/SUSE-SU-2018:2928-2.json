	"summary": "Security update for openssl",
	"details": "This update for openssl fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- Prevent One&Done side-channel attack on RSA that allowed physically near\n  attackers to use EM emanations to recover information (bsc#1104789)\n- CVE-2018-0737: The RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be\n  vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient\n  access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process\n  could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Add openssl(cli) Provide so the packages that require the openssl\n  binary can require this instead of the new openssl meta package\n  (bsc#1101470)\n- Fixed path to the engines which are under /lib64 on SLE-12 (bsc#1101246,\n  bsc#997043)\n",
