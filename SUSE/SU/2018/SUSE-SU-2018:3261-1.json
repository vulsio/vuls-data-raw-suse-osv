	"summary": "Security update for tomcat",
	"details": "This update for tomcat fixes the following issues:\n\nVersion update to 7.0.90:\n\n- Another bugfix release, for full details see:\n  https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-11784: When the default servlet in Apache Tomcat returned\n  a redirect to a directory (e.g. redirecting to '/foo/' when the user\n  requested '/foo') a specially crafted URL could be used to cause the\n  redirect to be generated to any URI of the attackers choice. (bsc#1110850)\n- CVE-2017-15706: As part of the fix for bug 61201, the documentation\n  for Apache Tomcat included an updated description of the search algorithm\n  used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute.  The update\n  was not correct. As a result, some scripts may have failed to execute as\n  expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly. Note that\n  the behaviour of the CGI servlet has remained unchanged in this regard.\n  It is only the documentation of the behaviour that was wrong and has\n  been corrected.(bsc#1078677)\n- CVE-2018-1304: The URL pattern of \\'\\' (the empty string) which exactly\n  maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat\n  when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the\n  constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised\n  users to gain access to web application resources that should have\n  been protected.  Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the\n  empty string were affected. (bsc#1082480)\n- CVE-2018-1305: Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets\n  in Apache Tomcat were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because\n  security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and\n  any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order\n  Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied.\n  This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to\n  access them.(bsc#1082481)\n- CVE-2018-1336: An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with\n  supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the decoder causing\n  a Denial of Service. (bsc#1102400)\n- CVE-2018-8014: Fixed default settings for the CORS filter, which were\n  insecure and enabled 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. (bsc#1093697)\n- CVE-2018-8034: Fixed the host name verification when using TLS with the\n  WebSocket client, which was not enabled by default. (bsc#1102379)\n",
