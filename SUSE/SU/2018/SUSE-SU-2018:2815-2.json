	"summary": "Security update for apache2",
	"details": "This update for apache2 fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2016-8743: Fixed liberal whitespace interpretation accepted from requests\n  and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors\n  represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of\n  proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through\n  mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request\n  smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution. (bsc#1016715)\n- CVE-2016-4975: Fixed possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting\n  attacks for sites which use mod_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes\n  which prohibit CR or LF injection into the 'Location' or other outbound\n  header key or value. (bsc#1104826)\n  ",
