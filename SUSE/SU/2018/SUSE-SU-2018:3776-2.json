	"details": "This update for openssh fixes the following issues:\n\nFollowing security issues have been fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-15919: Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH could be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system when GSS2 is in use. OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or 'oracle') as a vulnerability. (bsc#1106163)\n- CVE-2018-15473: OpenSSH was prone to a user existance oracle vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c. (bsc#1105010)\n\nAlso the following security related hardening change was done:\n\n- Remove arcfour,cast,blowfish from list of default ciphers. (bsc#982273)\n\nAnd the following non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Stop leaking File descriptors (bsc#964336)\n- sftp-client.c returns wrong error code upon failure (bsc#1091396)\n",
