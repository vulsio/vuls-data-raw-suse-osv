	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.12.14-95_80 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2022-1016: Fixed a vulnerability in the nf_tables component of the netfilter subsystem. This vulnerability gives an attacker a powerful primitive that can be used to both read from and write to relative stack data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. (bsc#1197335)\n- CVE-2022-1011: Fixed an use-after-free vulnerability which could allow a local attacker to retireve (partial) /etc/shadow hashes or any other data from filesystem when he can mount a FUSE filesystems. (bsc#1197344)\n- CVE-2021-39713: Fixed a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free (bsc#1197211).\n",
