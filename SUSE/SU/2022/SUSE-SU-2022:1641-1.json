	"summary": "Security update for the Linux Kernel (Live Patch 44 for SLE 12 SP3)",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.4.180-94_161 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2022-1011: A use-after-free flaw was found in the FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write(). This flaw allowed a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in privilege escalation. (bsc#1197344)\n- CVE-2021-39713: Fixed a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free. (bsc#1197211)\n- CVE-2021-28688: The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11 (bsc#1182294)\n",
