	"details": "This update for nbd fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2022-26495: Fixed an integer overflow with a resultant heap-based buffer overflow (bsc#1196827).\n- CVE-2022-26496: Fixed a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the name field by sending a crafted NBD_OPT_INFO (bsc#1196828). \n\n\nUpdate to version 3.24 (bsc#1196827, bsc#1196828, CVE-2022-26495, CVE-2022-26496):\n  * https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q9rw-8758-hccj\n\nUpdate to version 3.23:\n  * Don't overwrite the hostname with the TLS hostname\n\nUpdate to version 3.22:\n  - nbd-server: handle auth for v6-mapped IPv4 addresses \n  - nbd-client.c: parse the next option in all cases\n  - configure.ac: silence a few autoconf 2.71 warnings\n  - spec: Relax NBD_OPT_LIST_META_CONTEXTS \n  - client: Don't confuse Unix socket with TLS hostname\n  - server: Avoid deprecated g_memdup\n\nUpdate to version 3.21:\n  - Fix --disable-manpages build\n  - Fix a bug in whitespace handling regarding authorization files\n  - Support client-side marking of devices as read-only\n  - Support preinitialized NBD connection (i.e., skip the negotiation).\n  - Fix the systemd unit file for nbd-client so it works with netlink (the\n    more common situation nowadays)\n\nUpdate to 3.20.0 (no changelog)\n\nUpdate to version 3.19.0:\n  * Better error messages in case of unexpected disconnects\n  * Better compatibility with non-bash sh implementations\n    (for configure.sh)\n  * Fix for a segfault in NBD_OPT_INFO handling\n  * The ability to specify whether to listen on both TCP and Unix\n    domain sockets, rather than to always do so\n  * Various minor editorial and spelling fixes in the documentation.\n\nUpdate to version 1.18.0:\n  * Client: Add the '-g' option to avoid even trying the NBD_OPT_GO\n    message\n  * Server: fixes to inetd mode\n  * Don't make gnutls and libnl automagic.\n  * Server: bugfixes in handling of some export names during verification.\n  * Server: clean supplementary groups when changing user.\n  * Client: when using the netlink protocol, only set a timeout\n    when there actually is a timeout, rather than defaulting to 0\n    seconds\n  * Improve documentation on the nbdtab file\n  * Minor improvements to some error messages\n  * Improvements to test suite so it works better on non-GNU\n    userland environments\n\n- Update to version 1.17.0:\n  * proto: add xNBD command NBD_CMD_CACHE to the spec\n  * server: do not crash when handling child name\n  * server: Close socket pair when fork fails\n",
