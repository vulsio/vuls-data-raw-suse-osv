	"summary": "Security update for containerd",
	"details": "This update for containerd fixes the following issues:\n\ncontainerd:\n\n- CVE-2022-31030: Fixed denial of service via invocation of the ExecSync API (bsc#1200145)\n\ndocker:\n\n- Update to Docker 20.10.17-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201017 . bsc#1200145\n\nrunc:\n\nUpdate to runc v1.1.3.\n\nUpstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.3.\n\n* Our seccomp `-ENOSYS` stub now correctly handles multiplexed syscalls on\n  s390 and s390x. This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not\n  support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub\n  code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).\n* Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as\n  intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for\n  libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.\n* Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate\n  constants in libseccomp-golang.\n* When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,\n  to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.\n* Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.\n* Various CI fixes.\n* Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.\n    \n- Fix issues with newer syscalls (namely faccessat2) on older kernels on s390(x) caused by\n  that platform's syscall multiplexing semantics. (bsc#1192051 bsc#1199565)\n\nUpdate to runc v1.1.2.\n\nUpstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2.\n\nSecurity issue fixed:\n\n- CVE-2022-29162: A bug was found in runc where runc exec --cap executed processes with\n  non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux\n  environment. (bsc#1199460)\n\n- runc spec no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created\n  example OCI spec (config.json) file.\n\nUpdate to runc v1.1.1.\n\nUpstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.1.\n\n* runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,\n  rather than error out. (#3355)\n* runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)\n  libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files\n  listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's\n  cgroup. (#3387, #3404)\n* Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus 'Intel RDT is not supported'\n  error. (#3406)\n* libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat\n  of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)\n\nUpdate to runc v1.1.0.\n\nUpstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n\n- libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being\n  correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This\n  should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and\n  incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)\n\nUpdate to runc v1.1.0~rc1.\n\nUpstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.\n\n+ Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.\n+ runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.\n  This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures\n  (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent\n  binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.\n+ runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.\n  This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after\n  the container hasï¿¼exited.\n+ seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD\n  (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).\n+ seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows\n  users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be\n  efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.\n+ checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set\n  a different LSM mount context on restore.\n+ intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.\n+ runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup\n  to use for the process being executed.\n+ cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1\n  machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc\n  run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).\n+ sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s\n  behaviour.\n+ mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching\n  the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any\n  additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to\n  have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have\n  restrictive access control settings for other users.\n+ Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These\n  have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r\n  to the option name (such as rro).\n+ Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features\n  runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as\n  supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this\n  command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc\n  1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is\n  being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.\n* system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.\n* cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change\n  the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per\n  /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container\n  process.\n* runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount\n  which destination is a symlink.\n* cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.\n  runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused\n  container.\n* runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of\n  exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.\n",
