	"summary": "Security update for the Linux Kernel (Live Patch 20 for SLE 12 SP4)",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.12.14-95_74 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2022-1016: Fixed a vulnerability in the nf_tables component of the netfilter subsystem. This vulnerability gives an attacker a powerful primitive that can be used to both read from and write to relative stack data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. (bsc#1197335)\n- CVE-2022-1011: Fixed an use-after-free vulnerability which could allow a local attacker to retireve (partial) /etc/shadow hashes or any other data from filesystem when he can mount a FUSE filesystems. (bsc#1197344)\n- CVE-2021-39713: Fixed a race condition in the network scheduling subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free (bsc#1197211).\n- CVE-2022-27666: Fixed a buffer overflow vulnerability in IPsec ESP transformation code. This flaw allowed a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation. (bnc#1197133)\n",
