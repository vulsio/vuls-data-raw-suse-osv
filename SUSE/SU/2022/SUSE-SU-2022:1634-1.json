	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 5.3.18-150200_24_112 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- - CVE-2022-1158: Fixed KVM x86/mmu compare-and-exchange of gPTE via the user address (bsc#1198133)\n- CVE-2022-1011: A use-after-free flaw was found in the FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write(). This flaw allowed a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in privilege escalation. (bsc#1197344)\n- - CVE-2021-39698: In aio_poll_complete_work of aio.c, there was a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. (bsc#1196959)\n",
