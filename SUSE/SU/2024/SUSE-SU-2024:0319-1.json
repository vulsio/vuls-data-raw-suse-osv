	"summary": "Security update for gdb",
	"details": "This update for gdb fixes the following issues:\n\n- Drop libdebuginfod1 BuildRequires/Recommends. The former isn't\n  needed because there's a build requirement on libdebuginfod-devel\n  already, which will pull the shared library. And the latter,\n  because it's bogus since RPM auto generated dependency will take\n  care of that requirement.\n\ngdb was released in 13.2:\n\n* This version of GDB includes the following changes and enhancements:\n\n  * Support for the following new targets has been added in both GDB and GDBserver:\n\n        * GNU/Linux/LoongArch (gdbserver) loongarch*-*-linux*\n        * GNU/Linux/CSKY (gdbserver) csky*-*linux* \n\n  * The Windows native target now supports target async.\n  * Floating-point support has now been added on LoongArch GNU/Linux.\n  * New commands:\n\n        * set print nibbles [on|off]\n        * show print nibbles\n\n        * This controls whether the 'print/t' command will display binary values in groups of four bits, known as 'nibbles'. The default is 'off'.\n          Various styling-related commands. See the gdb/NEWS file for more details.\n          Various maintenance commands. These are normally aimed at GDB experts or developers. See the gdb/NEWS file for more details. \n\n  * Python API improvements:\n\n          * New Python API for instruction disassembly.\n\n          * The new attribute 'locations' of gdb.Breakpoint returns a list of gdb.BreakpointLocation objects specifying the locations where the breakpoint is inserted into the debuggee.\n          * New Python type gdb.BreakpointLocation.\n          * New function gdb.format_address(ADDRESS, PROGSPACE, ARCHITECTURE) that formats ADDRESS as 'address '\n          * New function gdb.current_language that returns the name of the current language. Unlike gdb.parameter('language'), this will never return 'auto'.\n          * New function gdb.print_options that returns a dictionary of the prevailing print options, in the form accepted by gdb.Value.format_string.\n          * New method gdb.Frame.language that returns the name of the frame's language.\n          * gdb.Value.format_string now uses the format provided by 'print', if it is called during a 'print' or other similar operation.\n          * gdb.Value.format_string now accepts the 'summary' keyword. This can be used to request a shorter representation of a value, the way that 'set print frame-arguments scalars' does.\n          * The gdb.register_window_type method now restricts the set of acceptable window names. The first character of a window's name must start with a character in the set [a-zA-Z], every subsequent character of a window's name must be in the set [-_.a-zA-Z0-9]. \n   * GDB/MI changes:\n\n          * MI version 1 is deprecated, and will be removed in GDB 14.\n          * The async record stating the stopped reason 'breakpoint-hit' now contains an optional field locno. \n\n   * Miscellaneous improvements:\n\n          * gdb now supports zstd compressed debug sections (ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD) for ELF.\n          * New convenience variable $_inferior_thread_count contains the number of live threads in the current inferior.\n          * New convenience variables $_hit_bpnum and $_hit_locno, set to the breakpoint number and the breakpoint location number of the breakpoint last hit.\n          * The 'info breakpoints' now displays enabled breakpoint locations of disabled breakpoints as in the 'y-' state.\n          * The format of 'disassemble /r' and 'record instruction-history /r' has changed to match the layout of GNU objdump when disassembling.\n\n          * A new format '/b' has been introduce to provide the old behavior of '/r'.\n          * The TUI no longer styles the source and assembly code highlighted by the current position indicator by default. You can however re-enable styling using the new 'set style tui-current-position' command.\n          * It is now possible to use the 'document' command to document user-defined commands.\n          * Support for memory tag data for AArch64 MTE. \n\n   * Support Removal notices:\n\n          * DBX mode has been removed.\n          * Support for building against Python version 2 has been removed. It is now only possible to build GDB against Python 3.\n          * Support for the following commands has been removed:\n\n          * set debug aix-solib on|off\n          * show debug aix-solib\n          * set debug solib-frv on|off\n          * show debug solib-frv\n\n          * Use the 'set/show debug solib' commands instead. \n\nSee the NEWS file for a more complete and detailed list of what this release includes. \n",
