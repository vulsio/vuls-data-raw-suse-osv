	"summary": "Security update for bind",
	"details": "This update for bind fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to 9.16.50:\n\n- Bug Fixes:\n  * A regression in cache-cleaning code enabled memory use to grow\n    significantly more quickly than before, until the configured\n    max-cache-size limit was reached. This has been fixed.\n  * Using rndc flush inadvertently caused cache cleaning to become\n    less effective. This could ultimately lead to the configured\n    max-cache-size limit being exceeded and has now been fixed.\n  * The logic for cleaning up expired cached DNS records was\n    tweaked to be more aggressive. This change helps with enforcing\n    max-cache-ttl and max-ncache-ttl in a timely manner.\n  * It was possible to trigger a use-after-free assertion when the\n    overmem cache cleaning was initiated. This has been fixed.\n  New Features:\n  * Added RESOLVER.ARPA to the built in empty zones.\n- Security Fixes:\n  * It is possible to craft excessively large numbers of resource\n    record types for a given owner name, which has the effect of\n    slowing down database processing. This has been addressed by\n    adding a configurable limit to the number of records that can\n    be stored per name and type in a cache or zone database. The\n    default is 100, which can be tuned with the new\n    max-types-per-name option. (CVE-2024-1737, bsc#1228256)\n  * Validating DNS messages signed using the SIG(0) protocol (RFC\n    2931) could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a\n    denial-of-service condition. Support for SIG(0) message\n    validation was removed from this version of named.\n    (CVE-2024-1975, bsc#1228257)\n  * When looking up the NS records of parent zones as part of\n    looking up DS records, it was possible for named to trigger an\n    assertion failure if serve-stale was enabled. This has been\n    fixed. (CVE-2024-4076, bsc#1228258)\n",
