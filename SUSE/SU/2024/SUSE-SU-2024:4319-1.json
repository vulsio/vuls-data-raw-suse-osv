	"summary": "Security update for docker",
	"details": "This update for docker fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update docker-buildx to v0.19.2. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.2>.\n\n  Some notable changelogs from the last update:\n    * <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.0>\n    * <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.18.0>\n\n- Add a new toggle file /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable which allows users to\n  disable the SUSEConnect integration with Docker (which creates special mounts\n  in /run/secrets to allow container-suseconnect to authenticate containers\n  with registries on registered hosts). bsc#1231348 bsc#1232999\n\n  In order to disable these mounts, just do\n\n    echo 0 > /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n\n  and restart Docker. In order to re-enable them, just do\n\n    echo 1 > /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Allow a parallel docker-stable RPM to exists in repositories.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1>\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. (bsc#1231348)\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic 'docker build' has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. (bsc#1230331)\n\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  (bsc#1230333)\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615>\n  bsc#1230294\n\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070 bsc#1229806\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553 bsc#1229806\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.4-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2614>\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.0-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2610>\n\n- Update --add-runtime to point to correct binary path.",
