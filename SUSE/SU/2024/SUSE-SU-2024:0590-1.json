	"details": "This update for bind fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to release 9.16.48:\n\nFeature Changes:\n* The IP addresses for B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET have been updated to\n  170.247.170.2 and 2801:1b8:10::b.\n\nSecurity Fixes:\n* Validating DNS messages containing a lot of DNSSEC signatures\n  could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a denial-of-service\n  condition. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-50387) [bsc#1219823]\n* Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof could cause excessive\n  CPU load, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This has\n  been fixed. (CVE-2023-50868) [bsc#1219826]\n* Parsing DNS messages with many different names could cause\n  excessive CPU load. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-4408) [bsc#1219851]\n* Specific queries could cause named to crash with an assertion\n  failure when nxdomain-redirect was enabled. This has been\n  fixed. (CVE-2023-5517) [bsc#1219852]\n* A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale could cause\n  named to crash with an assertion failure, when both of these\n  features were enabled. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-5679)\n  [bsc#1219853]\n* Query patterns that continuously triggered cache database\n  maintenance could cause an excessive amount of memory to be\n  allocated, exceeding max-cache-size and potentially leading to\n  all available memory on the host running named being exhausted.\n  This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-6516) [bsc#1219854]\n\nRemoved Features:\n* Support for using AES as the DNS COOKIE algorithm\n  (cookie-algorithm aes;) has been deprecated and will be removed\n  in a future release. Please use the current default,\n  SipHash-2-4, instead.\n",
