	"summary": "Security update for pcp",
	"details": "This update for pcp fixes the following issues:\n\npcp was updated from version 3.11.9 to version 6.2.0 (jsc#PED-8192, jsc#PED-8389):\n\n- Security issues fixed:\n    \n  * CVE-2024-45770: Fixed a symlink attack that allows escalating from the pcp to the root user (bsc#1230552)\n  * CVE-2024-45769: Fixed a heap corruption through metric pmstore operations (bsc#1230551)\n  * CVE-2023-6917: Fixed local privilege escalation from pcp user to root in /usr/libexec/pcp/lib/pmproxy (bsc#1217826)\n  * CVE-2024-3019: Disabled redis proxy by default (bsc#1222121)\n\n- Major changes:\n\n  * Add version 3 PCP archive support: instance domain change-deltas,\n    Y2038-safe timestamps, nanosecond-precision timestamps, arbitrary timezones support, 64-bit file offsets used \n    throughout for larger (beyond 2GB) individual volumes.\n    + Opt-in using the /etc/pcp.conf PCP_ARCHIVE_VERSION setting\n    + Version 2 archives remain the default (for next few years).\n  * Switch to using OpenSSL only throughout PCP (dropped NSS/NSPR);\n    this impacts on libpcp, PMAPI clients and PMCD use of encryption;\n    these are now configured and used consistently with pmproxy HTTPS support and redis-server, which were both already\n    using OpenSSL.\n  * New nanosecond precision timestamp PMAPI calls for PCP library interfaces that make use of timestamps.  \n    These are all optional, and full backward compatibility is preserved for existing tools.\n  * For the full list of changes please consult the packaged CHANGELOG file\n\n- Other packaging changes:\n\n  * Reintroduce libuv support for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (bsc#1231345)\n  * Moved pmlogger_daily into main package (bsc#1222815)\n  * Switched logutil and pmieutil scripts from Type=oneshot to Type=exec (bsc#1186511)\n  * Change dependency from openssl-devel >= 1.1.1 to openssl-devel >= 1.0.2p.\n    Required for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12.\n  * Disabled 'pmda-infiniband' subpackage for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 to resolve build issues.\n  * Introduce 'pmda-resctrl' package, disabled for architectures other than x86_64.\n  * Change the architecture for various subpackages to 'noarch' as they contain no binaries.\n  * Disable 'pmda-mssql', as it fails to build.\n",
