	"summary": "Security update for liboqs, oqs-provider",
	"details": "This update for liboqs, oqs-provider fixes the following issues:\n\nThis update supplies the new FIPS standardized ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SHL-DSA algorithms.\n\nThis update liboqs to 0.12.0:\n\n  - This release updates the ML-DSA implementation to the [final\n    FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final) version. This\n    release still includes the NIST Round 3 version of Dilithium for\n    interoperability purposes, but we plan to remove Dilithium Round 3 in\n    a future release.\n  - This will be the last release of liboqs to include Kyber (that is,\n    the NIST Round 3 version of Kyber, prior to its standardization by NIST\n    as ML-KEM in FIPS 203). Applications should switch to ML-KEM (FIPS 203).\n  - The addition of ML-DSA FIPS 204 final version to liboqs has\n    introduced a new signature API which includes a context string\n    parameter. We are planning to remove the old version of the API\n    without a context string in the next release to streamline the\n    API and bring it in line with NIST specifications. Users who\n    have an opinion on this removal are invited to provide input at\n    https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/2001.\n\n  Security issues:\n\n  - CVE-2024-54137: Fixed bug in HQC decapsulation that leads to incorrect\n    shared secret value during decapsulation when called with an invalid\n    ciphertext. (bsc#1234292)\n  - new library major version 7\n\nUpdated to 0.11.0:\n\n  * This release updates ML-KEM implementations to their final FIPS 203\n    https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final versions .\n  * This release still includes the NIST Round 3 version of Kyber for\n    interoperability purposes, but we plan to remove Kyber Round 3 in a\n    future release.\n  * Additionally, this release adds support for MAYO and CROSS\n    digital signature schemes from [NIST Additional Signatures Round 1\n    https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-1-additional-signatures\n    along with stateful hash-based signature schemes XMSS\n    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8391 and LMS\n    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8554.\n  * Finally, this release provides formally verified\n    implementations of Kyber-512 and Kyber-768 from libjade\n    https://github.com/formosa-crypto/libjade/releases/tag/release%2F2023.05-2\n  * LMS and XMSS are disabled by default due to the security risks associated with their use in software.\n    See the note on stateful hash-based signatures in CONFIGURE.md\n  * Key encapsulation mechanisms:\n  - Kyber: Added formally-verified portable C and AVX2 implementations\n    of Kyber-512 and Kyber-768 from libjade.\n  - ML-KEM: Updated portable C and AVX2 implementations of ML-KEM-512,\n    ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024 to FIP 203 version.\n  - Kyber: Patched ARM64 implementations of Kyber-512, Kyber-768, and\n    Kyber-1024 to work with AddressSanitizer.\n  * Digital signature schemes:\n  - LMS/XMSS: Added implementations of stateful hash-based signature\n    schemes: XMSS and LMS\n  - MAYO: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of MAYO signature\n    scheme from NIST Additional Signatures Round 1.\n  - CROSS: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of CROSS signature\n    scheme from NIST Additional Signatures Round 1.\n  * Other changes:\n  - Added callback API to use custom implementations of AES, SHA2, and SHA3.\n  - Refactor SHA3 implementation to use OpenSSL's EVP_DigestSqueeze() API.\n\n  - new library major version 6\n\nUpdated to 0.10.1:\n\n- This release is a security release which fixes potential\n  non-constant-time behaviour in ML-KEM and Kyber. (bsc#1226162\n  CVE-2024-36405)\n  It also includes a fix for incorrectly named macros in the ML-DSA\n  implementation.\n\nupdated to 0.10.0:\n\n  Key encapsulation mechanisms:\n\n  - BIKE: Updated portable C implementation to include constant-time fixes from upstream.\n  - HQC: Updated to NIST Round 4 version.\n  - ML-KEM: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of Initial Public Draft (IPD) versions of ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.\n\n  Digital signature schemes:\n\n  - Falcon: Updated portable C, AVX2, and AArch64 implementations to support fixed-length (PADDED-format) signatures. Fixed the maximum length of variable-length signatures to comply with the NIST Round 3 specification.\n  - ML-DSA: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of Initial Public Draft (IPD) versions of ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87.\n\n  Other changes:\n\n  - Improved thread safety.\n  - Removed support for the 'NIST-KAT' DRBG.\n  - Added extended KAT test programs.\n\n- library major version changed from 4 to 5\n\nThis update also updates oqs-provider to 0.7.0:\n\n\n- Adds support for MAYO from Round 1 of NIST’s Post-Quantum Signature On-Ramp process.\n- Adds support for CROSS from Round 1 of NIST’s Post-Quantum Signature On-Ramp process.\n- Updates ML-KEM's code points in line with internet draft draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-02.\n- Reverses keyshares for X25519MLKEM768 and X448-ML-KEM-768 TLS hybrids in line with draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-02.\n\nUpdated to 0.6.1:\n\n- CVE-2024-37305: Fixed buffer overflow in deserialization of hybrid keys and signatures (bsc#1226468)\n\nUpdated to 0.6.0:\n\n- First availability of standardized PQ algorithms, e.g., ML-KEM, ML-DSA\n- Support for Composite PQ operations\n- Alignment with PQ algorithm implementations as provided by liboqs 0.10.0, most notably updating HQC and Falcon.\n- Implementation of security code review recommendations\n- Support for more hybrid operations as fully documented here.\n- Support for extraction of classical and hybrid key material\n\nUpdated to 0.5.3:\n\n- only tracking parallel liboqs security update\n\nUpdated to 0.5.2:\n\n- Algorithm updates as documented in the liboqs 0.9.0 release notes\n- Standard coding style\n- Enhanced memory leak protection\n- Added community cooperation documentation\n- (optional) KEM algorithm en-/decoder feature\n\nUpdated to 0.5.1:\n\n- Documentation update\n- document specs\n- General documentation overhaul\n- change TLS demo to use QSC alg\n- Build a module instead of a shared library.\n- explain groups in USAGE\n",
