	"summary": "Security update for apache2",
	"details": "Apache2 updated to fix four security issues and one non-security bug.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities have been fixed:\n\n- mod_headers rules could be bypassed via chunked requests. Adds 'MergeTrailers'\n  directive to restore legacy behavior. (bsc#871310, CVE-2013-5704)\n- An empty value in Content-Type could lead to a crash through a null pointer\n  dereference and a denial of service. (bsc#899836, CVE-2014-3581)\n- Remote attackers could bypass intended access restrictions in mod_lua\n  LuaAuthzProvider when multiple Require directives with different arguments\n  are used. (bsc#909715, CVE-2014-8109)\n- Remote attackers could cause a denial of service (child-process crash) by\n  sending a crafted WebSocket Ping frame after a Lua script has called the\n  wsupgrade function. (bsc#918352, CVE-2015-0228)\n\nThe following non-security issues have been fixed:\n\n- The Apache2 systemd service file was changed to fix situation where apache wouldn't\n  start at boot when using an encrypted certificate because the user wasn't prompted\n  for password during boot. (bsc#792309)\n\nAdditionally, mod_imagemap is now included by default in the package. (bsc#923090)\n",
