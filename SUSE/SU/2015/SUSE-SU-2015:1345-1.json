	"summary": "Security update for java-1_6_0-ibm",
	"details": "IBM Java was updated to 6.0-16.7 to fix several security issues.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities were fixed:\n\n* CVE-2015-1931: IBM Java Security Components store plain text data in memory dumps, which could allow a local attacker to obtain information to aid in further attacks against the system.\n* CVE-2015-2590: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the Libraries component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-2601: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JCE component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-2621: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JMX component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-2625: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-2632: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-2637: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-2638: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-2664: Difficult to exploit vulnerability in the Deployment component requiring logon to Operating System. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-2808: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some Java accessible data as well as read access to a subset of Java accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-4000: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some Java accessible data as well as read access to a subset of Java Embedded accessible data.\n* CVE-2015-4731: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JMX component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-4732: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the Libraries component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-4733: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the RMI component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-4748: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the Security component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via OCSP. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n* CVE-2015-4749: Difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JNDI component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS).\n* CVE-2015-4760: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe following non-security bugs were fixed:\n\n* bsc#936844: misconfigured update-alternative entries\n",
