	"summary": "Security update for openssh",
	"details": "openssh was updated to fix four security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2015-5352: The x11_open_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacked a check of the refusal deadline for X connections, which made it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the permitted time window (bsc#936695).\n- CVE-2015-5600: The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH did not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which made it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list (bsc#938746).\n- CVE-2015-4000: Removed and disabled weak DH groups (bsc#932483).\n- Hardening patch to fix sftp RCE (bsc#903649).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n- bsc#914309: sshd inherits oom_adj -17 on SIGHUP causing DoS potential for oom_killer.\n- bsc#673532: limits.conf fsize change in SLES10SP3 causing problems to WebSphere mqm user.\n  ",
