	"details": "\nMozillaFirefox was updated to the 31.5.3ESR release to fix two security \nvulnerabilities:\n\n    * \n\n      MFSA 2015-29 / CVE-2015-0817: Security researcher ilxu1a reported,\n      through HP Zero Day Initiative's Pwn2Own contest, a flaw in Mozilla's\n      implementation of typed array bounds checking in JavaScript\n      just-in-time compilation (JIT) and its management of bounds checking\n      for heap access. This flaw can be leveraged into the reading and\n      writing of memory allowing for arbitary code execution on the local\n      system.\n\n    * \n\n      MFSA 2015-28 / CVE-2015-0818: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski\n      reported, through HP Zero Day Initiative's Pwn2Own contest, a method\n      to run arbitrary scripts in a privileged context. This bypassed the\n      same-origin policy protections by using a flaw in the processing of\n      SVG format content navigation.\n\nSecurity Issues:\n\n    * CVE-2015-0817\n      <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0817>\n    * CVE-2015-0818\n      <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0818>\n\n",
