	"summary": "Security update for openssl",
	"details": "\nThis update for openssl fixes the following issues: \n\nSecurity fixes:\n- CVE-2015-3194: The signature verification routines will crash with a\n  NULL pointer dereference if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the\n  RSA PSS algorithm and absent mask generation function parameter. Since\n  these routines are used to verify certificate signature algorithms\n  this can be used to crash any certificate verification operation and\n  exploited in a DoS attack. Any application which performs certificate\n  verification is vulnerable including OpenSSL clients and servers which\n  enable client authentication. (bsc#957815)\n- CVE-2015-3195: When presented with a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure OpenSSL would leak\n  memory. This structure is used by the PKCS#7 and CMS routines so any\n  application which reads PKCS#7 or CMS data from untrusted sources is affected.\n  SSL/TLS is not affected. (bsc#957812)\n- CVE-2015-3196: If PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client then\n  the values were wrongly updated in the parent SSL_CTX structure. This could\n  result in a race condition potentially leading to a double free of the\n  identify hint data.  (bsc#957813)\n\nNon security bugs fixed:\n- Improve S/390 performance on IBM z196 and z13 (bsc#954256)\n- Add support for 'ciphers' providing no encryption (bsc#937085)\n",
