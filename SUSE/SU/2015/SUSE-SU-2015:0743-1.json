trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the 'CCS Injection' vulnerability (bnc#915913).\n- CVE-2014-3470: The ssl3_send_client_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h, when an anonymous ECDH cipher suite is used, allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and client crash) by triggering a NULL certificate value (bnc#915913).\n-

in Oracle MySQL Server 5.5.38 and earlier and 5.6.19 and earlier allowed local users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to SERVER:MyISAM (bnc#896400).\n- CVE-2014-4287: Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle MySQL Server 5.5.38 and earlier and 5.6.19 and earlier allowed remote authenticated users to affect availability via vectors related to
