	"summary": "Security update for sudo",
	"details": "\nThis update for sudo fixes the following issues:\n\n- Fix two security vulnerabilities that allowed users to bypass\n  sudo's NOEXEC functionality:\n  * noexec bypass via system() and popen() [CVE-2016-7032, bsc#1007766]\n  * noexec bypass via wordexp() [CVE-2016-7076, bsc#1007501]\n\n- The SSSD plugin would occasionally crash sudo with an 'internal error'.\n  This issue has been fixed. [bsc#948973]\n\n- The SSSD plugin would occasionally apply @netgroups rules from LDAP to all\n  users rather than the @netgroup. This issue is now fixed. [bsc#966755]\n\n- When the SSSD plugin was used and a local user ran sudo, an e-mail used to be\n  sent to administrator because SSSD did not support sudo rules for local\n  users. This message did not signify an error, however, it was only noise.\n  [bsc#1008043]\n\n",
