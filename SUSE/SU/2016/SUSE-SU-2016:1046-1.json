	"summary": "Security update for Linux Kernel Live Patch 5",
	"details": "\nThis update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.43-52.6.1 fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2016-2384: A malicious USB device could cause a kernel crash in\n  the alsa usb-audio driver. (bsc#967773)\n\n- CVE-2015-8812: A flaw was found in the CXGB3 kernel driver when\n  the network was considered congested.  The kernel would incorrectly\n  misinterpret the congestion as an error condition and incorrectly\n  free/clean up the skb. When the device would then send the skb's queued,\n  these structures would be referenced and may panic the system or allow\n  an attacker to escalate privileges in a use-after-free scenario. (bsc#966683)\n\n- CVE-2016-0774: A pipe buffer state corruption after unsuccessful atomic\n  read from pipe was fixed (bsc#964732).\n\n- CVE-2015-8709: kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel mishandled uid and\n  gid mappings, which allowed local users to gain privileges by establishing\n  a user namespace, waiting for a root process to enter that namespace\n  with an unsafe uid or gid, and then using the ptrace system call. NOTE:\n  the vendor states 'there is no kernel bug here.' (bsc#960563)\n",
