	"details": "\nThis update for apache2-mod_fcgid fixes the following issues:\n \n* It used to be possible to set an arbitrary $HTTP_PROXY environment variable\n  for request handlers -- like CGI scripts -- by including a specially crafted\n  HTTP header in the request (CVE-2016-1000104). As a result, these server\n  components would potentially direct all their outgoing HTTP traffic through a\n  malicious proxy server. This patch fixes the issue: the updated Apache server\n  ignores such HTTP headers and never sets $HTTP_PROXY for sub-processes\n  (unless a value has been explicitly configured by the administrator in the\n  configuration file). (bsc#988492)\n",
