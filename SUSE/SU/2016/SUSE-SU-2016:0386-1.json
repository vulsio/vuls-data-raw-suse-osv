	"details": "\nThis kernel live patch for Linux Kernel 3.12.44-52.10.1 fixes security issues and bugs:\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n- CVE-2015-8539: A negatively instantiated user key could have been used\n  by a local user to leverage privileges (bnc#958601).\n\n- CVE-2015-6937: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Reliable\n  Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation allowing a local user to cause\n  system DoS. A verification was missing that the underlying transport\n  exists when a connection was created. (bsc#953052)\n\n- CVE-2015-7990: RDS: Verify the underlying transport exists before\n  creating a connection, preventing possible DoS (bsc#953052).\n\n- CVE-2015-7872: Possible crash when trying to garbage collect an\n  uninstantiated keyring (bsc#951542).\n\n- CVE-2015-2925: The prepend_path function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux\n  kernel did not properly handle rename actions inside a bind mount, which\n  allowed local users to bypass an intended container protection mechanism\n  by renaming a directory, related to a 'double-chroot attack (bnc#951625).\n\nNon-security bugfix were also done:\n- xfs: Fix lost direct IO write in the last block (bsc#954005).\n- simple fix in kallsyms initialization (bsc#940342 bsc#916225)\n  ",
