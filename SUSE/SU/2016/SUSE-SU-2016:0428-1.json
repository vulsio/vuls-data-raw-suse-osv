	"details": "\nThis update for java-1_6_0-ibm fixes the following issues by updating to 6.0-16.20 (bsc#963937)\n\n- CVE-2015-5041: Could could have invoked non-public interface methods under certain circumstances\n- CVE-2015-7575: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials\n- CVE-2015-7981: libpng could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the png_convert_to_rfc1123 function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information\n- CVE-2015-8126: buffer overflow in libpng caused by improper bounds checking by the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions\n- CVE-2015-8472: buffer overflow in libpng caused by improper bounds checking by the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions\n- CVE-2015-8540: libpng is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by a read underflow in png_check_keyword in pngwutil.c. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.\n- CVE-2016-0402: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Networking component has no confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact\n- CVE-2016-0448: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JMX component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information\n- CVE-2016-0466: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JAXP component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service\n- CVE-2016-0483: An unspecified vulnerability related to the AWT component has complete confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, and complete availability impact\n- CVE-2016-0494: An unspecified vulnerability related to the 2D component has complete confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, and complete availability impact\n\nThe following bugs were fixed:\n\n- bsc#960402: resolve package conflicts in devel package\n- bsc#960286: resolve package conflicts in the fonts subpackage\n",
