	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.62-60_64_8 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n- CVE-2016-8666: The IP stack in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for packets with tunnel stacking, as demonstrated by interleaved IPv4 headers and GRE headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-7039 (bsc#1001487).\n- CVE-2016-6480: Race condition in the ioctl_send_fib function in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value, aka a 'double fetch' vulnerability (bsc#991667).\n",
