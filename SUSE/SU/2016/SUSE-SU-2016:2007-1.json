	"summary": "Security update for Linux Kernel Live Patch 3 for SLE 12 SP1",
	"details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.53-60_30 fixes the several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2016-4470: The key_reject_and_link function in security/keys/key.c in the Linux kernel did not ensure that a certain data structure is initialized, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via vectors involving a crafted keyctl request2 command (bsc#984764).\n- CVE-2016-1583: The ecryptfs_privileged_open function in fs/ecryptfs/kthread.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (stack memory consumption) via vectors involving crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling (bsc#983144).\n- CVE-2016-4565: The InfiniBand (aka IB) stack in the Linux kernel incorrectly relied on the write system call, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (kernel memory write operation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a uAPI interface (bsc#980883).\n- CVE-2016-0758: Integer overflow in lib/asn1_decoder.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges via crafted ASN.1 data (bsc#980856).\n- CVE-2016-2053: The asn1_ber_decoder function in lib/asn1_decoder.c in the Linux kernel allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via an ASN.1 BER file that lacks a public key, leading to mishandling by the public_key_verify_signature function in crypto/asymmetric_keys/public_key.c (bsc#979074).\n- CVE-2015-8816: The hub_activate function in drivers/usb/core/hub.c in the Linux kernel did not properly maintain a hub-interface data structure, which allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by unplugging a USB hub device (bsc#979064).\n- CVE-2016-3134: The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not validate certain offset fields, which allowed local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via an IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt call (bsc#971793).\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n- bsc#973570: The fix for CVE-2013-7446 introduced a bug that could have possibly lead to a softlockup. \n",
