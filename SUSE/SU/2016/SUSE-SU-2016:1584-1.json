	"details": "ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p8 to fix five security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2016-4953: Bad authentication demobilizes ephemeral associations (bsc#982065).\n- CVE-2016-4954: Processing spoofed server packets (bsc#982066).\n- CVE-2016-4955: Autokey association reset (bsc#982067).\n- CVE-2016-4956: Broadcast interleave (bsc#982068).\n- CVE-2016-4957: CRYPTO_NAK crash (bsc#982064).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n- Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the parent returns.\n- bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker process to avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.\n- bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().\n- Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is needed e.g. by 'rcntp addserver'.\n",
