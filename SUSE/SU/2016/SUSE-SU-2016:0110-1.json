async NLM' option is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8719: The dissect_dns_answer function in epan/dissectors/packet-dns.c in the DNS dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 mishandles the EDNS0 Client Subnet option, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8720: The dissect_ber_GeneralizedTime function in epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c in the BER dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 improperly checks an sscanf return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8721: Buffer overflow in the tvb_uncompress function in epan/tvbuff_zlib.c in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet with zlib compression.\n* CVE-2015-8722: epan/dissectors/packet-sctp.c in the SCTP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the frame pointer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8723: The AirPDcapPacketProcess function in epan/crypt/airpdcap.c in the 802.11 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the relationship between the total length and the capture length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted\n* CVE-2015-8724: The AirPDcapDecryptWPABroadcastKey function in epan/crypt/airpdcap.c in the 802.11 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not verify the WPA broadcast key length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8725: The dissect_diameter_base_framed_ipv6_prefix function in epan/dissectors/packet-diameter.c in the DIAMETER dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the IPv6 prefix length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8726: wiretap/vwr.c in the VeriWave file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate certain signature and Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file.\n* CVE-2015-8727: The dissect_rsvp_common function in epan/dissectors/packet-rsvp.c in the RSVP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not properly maintain request-key data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8728: The Mobile Identity parser in (1) epan/dissectors/packet-ansi_a.c in the ANSI A dissector and (2) epan/dissectors/packet-gsm_a_common.c in the GSM A dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 improperly uses the tvb_bcd_dig_to_wmem_packet_str function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8729: The ascend_seek function in wiretap/ascendtext.c in the Ascend file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not ensure the presence of a '\\0' character at the end of a date string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file.\n* CVE-2015-8730: epan/dissectors/packet-nbap.c in the NBAP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the number of items, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read operation and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8731: The dissct_rsl_ipaccess_msg function in epan/dissectors/packet-rsl.c in the RSL dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not reject unknown TLV types, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8732: The dissect_zcl_pwr_prof_pwrprofstatersp function in epan/dissectors/packet-zbee-zcl-general.c in the ZigBee ZCL dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the Total Profile Number field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n* CVE-2015-8733: The ngsniffer_process_record function in wiretap/ngsniffer.c in the Sniffer file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the relationships between record lengths and record header lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file.\n\n",
