	"details": "This update for ansible to version 2.9.6 fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2019-14904: Fixed a vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone (boo#1157968).\n- CVE-2019-14905: Fixed an issue where malicious code could craft filename in nxos_file_copy module (boo#1157969).\n- CVE-2019-14864: Fixed Splunk and Sumologic callback plugins leak sensitive data in logs (boo#1154830).\n- CVE-2019-14846: Fixed secrets disclosure on logs due to display is hardcoded to DEBUG level (boo#1153452)\n- CVE-2019-14856: Fixed insufficient fix for CVE-2019-10206 (boo#1154232)\n- CVE-2019-14858: Fixed data in the sub parameter fields that will not be masked\n  and will be displayed when run with increased verbosity (boo#1154231) \n- CVE-2019-10206: ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools prompt passwords by\n  expanding them from templates as they could contain special characters. \n  Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and exposing them. (boo#1142690)\n- CVE-2019-10217: Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by no_log\n  feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. \n  service_account_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not \n  setting no_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be \n  leak as an output when running ansible playbooks. (boo#1144453)\n\nThis update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update update project.",
