The following items were fixed and/or added:\n  GUI: Fixes file name changes in the File location field when creating Virtual Hard Disk (bug #19286)\n  VMM: Fixed running VMs which failed to start with VERR_NEM_MISSING_KERNEL_API_2 when Hyper-V is used (bug #19779 and #19804)\n  Audio: fix regression in HDA emulation introduced in 6.1.0\n  Shared Clipboard: Fixed a potential crash when copying HTML data (6.1.2 regression; bug #19226)\n  Linux host and guest: Linux kernel version 5.8 support\n  EFI: Fixed reading ISO9660 filesystems on attached media (6.1.0 regression; bug #19682)\n  EFI: Support booting from drives attached to the LsiLogic SCSI and SAS controller emulations\n\nPseudo version bump to 6.1.13, which is NOT an Oracle release.\n\n  Update VB sources to run under kernel 5.8.0+ with no modifications to the\n  kernel.
