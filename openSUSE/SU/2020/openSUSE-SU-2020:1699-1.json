	"summary": "Security update for bind",
	"details": "This update for bind fixes the following issues:\n\nBIND was upgraded to version 9.16.6:\n\nNote:\n\n- bind is now more strict in regards to DNSSEC. If queries are not working,\n  check for DNSSEC issues. For instance, if bind is used in a namserver\n  forwarder chain, the forwarding DNS servers must support DNSSEC.\n\nFixing security issues:\n\n- CVE-2020-8616: Further limit the number of queries that can be triggered from\n  a request.  Root and TLD servers are no longer exempt\n  from max-recursion-queries.  Fetches for missing name server. (bsc#1171740)\n  Address records are limited to 4 for any domain.\n- CVE-2020-8617: Replaying a TSIG BADTIME response as a request could trigger an\n  assertion failure. (bsc#1171740)\n- CVE-2019-6477: Fixed an issue where TCP-pipelined queries could bypass \n  the tcp-clients limit (bsc#1157051).\n- CVE-2018-5741: Fixed the documentation (bsc#1109160).\n- CVE-2020-8618: It was possible to trigger an INSIST when determining\n  whether a record would fit into a TCP message buffer (bsc#1172958).\n- CVE-2020-8619: It was possible to trigger an INSIST in\n  lib/dns/rbtdb.c:new_reference() with a particular zone content\n  and query patterns (bsc#1172958).\n- CVE-2020-8624: 'update-policy' rules of type 'subdomain' were\n  incorrectly treated as 'zonesub' rules, which allowed\n  keys used in 'subdomain' rules to update names outside\n  of the specified subdomains. The problem was fixed by\n  making sure 'subdomain' rules are again processed as\n  described in the ARM (bsc#1175443).\n- CVE-2020-8623: When BIND 9 was compiled with native PKCS#11 support, it\n  was possible to trigger an assertion failure in code\n  determining the number of bits in the PKCS#11 RSA public\n  key with a specially crafted packet (bsc#1175443).\n- CVE-2020-8621: named could crash in certain query resolution scenarios\n  where QNAME minimization and forwarding were both\n  enabled (bsc#1175443).\n- CVE-2020-8620: It was possible to trigger an assertion failure by\n  sending a specially crafted large TCP DNS message (bsc#1175443).\n- CVE-2020-8622: It was possible to trigger an assertion failure when\n  verifying the response to a TSIG-signed request (bsc#1175443).\n\nOther issues fixed:\n\n- Add engine support to OpenSSL EdDSA implementation.\n- Add engine support to OpenSSL ECDSA implementation.\n- Update PKCS#11 EdDSA implementation to PKCS#11 v3.0.\n- Warn about AXFR streams with inconsistent message IDs.\n- Make ISC rwlock implementation the default again.\n- Fixed issues when using cookie-secrets for AES and SHA2 (bsc#1161168)\n- Installed the default files in /var/lib/named and created \n  chroot environment on systems using transactional-updates (bsc#1100369, fate#325524)\n- Fixed an issue where bind was not working in FIPS mode (bsc#906079).\n- Fixed dependency issues (bsc#1118367 and bsc#1118368).\n- GeoIP support is now discontinued, now GeoIP2 is used(bsc#1156205).\n- Fixed an issue with FIPS (bsc#1128220).\n- The liblwres library is discontinued upstream and is no longer included.\n- Added service dependency on NTP to make sure the clock is accurate when bind is starts (bsc#1170667, bsc#1170713).\n- Reject DS records at the zone apex when loading master files. Log but otherwise ignore attempts to add DS records at the zone apex via UPDATE.\n- The default value of 'max-stale-ttl' has been changed from 1 week to 12 hours.\n- Zone timers are now exported via statistics channel.\n- The 'primary' and 'secondary' keywords, when used as parameters for 'check-names', were not processed correctly and were being ignored.\n- 'rndc dnstap -roll <value>' did not limit the number of saved files to <value>.\n- Add 'rndc dnssec -status' command.\n- Addressed a couple of situations where named could crash.\n- Changed /var/lib/named to owner root:named and perms rwxrwxr-t\n  so that named, being a/the only member of the 'named' group\n  has full r/w access yet cannot change directories owned by root\n  in the case of a compromized named.\n  [bsc#1173307, bind-chrootenv.conf]\n- Added '/etc/bind.keys' to NAMED_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES in /etc/sysconfig/named to suppress warning message re missing file (bsc#1173983).\n- Removed '-r /dev/urandom' from all invocations of rndc-confgen\n  (init/named system/lwresd.init system/named.init in vendor-files)\n  as this option is deprecated and causes rndc-confgen to fail.\n  (bsc#1173311, bsc#1176674, bsc#1170713)\n- /usr/bin/genDDNSkey: Removing the use of the -r option in the call\n  of /usr/sbin/dnssec-keygen as BIND now uses the random number\n  functions provided by the crypto library (i.e., OpenSSL or a\n  PKCS#11 provider) as a source of randomness rather than /dev/random.\n  Therefore the -r command line option no longer has any effect on\n  dnssec-keygen. Leaving the option in genDDNSkey as to not break\n  compatibility. Patch provided by Stefan Eisenwiener.\n  [bsc#1171313]\n- Put libns into a separate subpackage to avoid file conflicts\n  in the libisc subpackage due to different sonums (bsc#1176092).\n- Require /sbin/start_daemon: both init scripts, the one used in\n  systemd context as well as legacy sysv, make use of start_daemon.\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.",
