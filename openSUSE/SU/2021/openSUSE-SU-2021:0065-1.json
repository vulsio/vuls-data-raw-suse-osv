	"summary": "Security update for nodejs10",
	"details": "This update for nodejs10 fixes the following issues:\n\n- New upstream LTS version 10.23.1:\n  * CVE-2020-8265: use-after-free in TLSWrap (High) bug in TLS\n    implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket,\n    node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with\n    a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument.\n    If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is\n    passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure.\n    This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a\n    Denial of Service or potentially other exploits (bsc#1180553)\n  * CVE-2020-8287: HTTP Request Smuggling allow two copies of a\n    header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding\n    header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header\n    field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request\n    Smuggling (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/444.html).\n    (bsc#1180554)\n  * CVE-2020-1971: OpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference\n    (High) This is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited\n    through Node.js. (bsc#1179491)\n\n- New upstream LTS version 10.23.0:\n  * deps: upgrade npm to 6.14.8\n  * n-api:\n    + create N-API version 7\n    + expose napi_build_version variable\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.",
