	"details": "This update for tor fixes the following issues:\n\ntor 0.4.6.7:\n\n* Fix a DoS via a remotely triggerable assertion failure\n  (boo#1189489, TROVE-2021-007, CVE-2021-38385)\n\ntor 0.4.6.6:\n\n* Enable the deterministic RNG for unit tests that covers the\n  address set bloomfilter-based API's\n\ntor 0.4.6.5\n\n* Add controller support for creating v3 onion services with\n  client auth\n* When voting on a relay with a Sybil-like appearance, add the\n  Sybil flag when clearing out the other flags. This lets a relay\n  operator know why their relay hasn't been included in the\n  consensus\n* Relays now report how overloaded they are\n* Add a new DoS subsystem to control the rate of client\n  connections for relays\n* Relays now publish statistics about v3 onions services\n* Improve circuit timeout algorithm for client performance\n",
