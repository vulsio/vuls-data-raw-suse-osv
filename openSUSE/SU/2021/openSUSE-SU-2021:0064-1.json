	"summary": "Security update for nodejs12",
	"details": "This update for nodejs12 fixes the following issues:\n\n- New upstream LTS version 12.20.1:\n  * CVE-2020-8265: use-after-free in TLSWrap (High) bug in TLS\n    implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket,\n    node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with\n    a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument.\n    If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is\n    passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure.\n    This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a\n    Denial of Service or potentially other exploits (bsc#1180553)\n  * CVE-2020-8287: HTTP Request Smuggling allow two copies of a\n    header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding\n    header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header\n    field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request\n    Smuggling (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/444.html).\n    (bsc#1180554)\n  * CVE-2020-1971: OpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference\n    (High) This is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited\n    through Node.js. (bsc#1179491)\n\n- New upstream LTS version 12.20.0:\n  * deps:\n    + update llhttp '2.1.2' -> '2.1.3'\n    + update uv '1.39.0' -> '1.40.0'\n    + update uvwasi '0.0.10' -> '0.0.11'\n  * fs: add .ref() and .unref() methods to watcher classes\n  * http: added scheduling option to http agent\n  * module:\n    + exports pattern support\n    + named exports for CJS via static analysis\n  * n-api: add more property defaults (gh#35214)\n\n- New upstream LTS version 12.19.1:\n  * deps: Denial of Service through DNS request (High).\n  A Node.js application that allows an attacker to trigger a DNS\n  request for a host of their choice could trigger a Denial of Service\n  by getting the application to resolve a DNS record with\n  a larger number of responses (bsc#1178882, CVE-2020-8277)\n\n- New upstream LTS version 12.19.0:\n  * crypto: add randomInt function\n  * deps:\n    + upgrade to libuv 1.39.0\n    + deps: upgrade npm to 6.14.7\n    + deps: upgrade to libuv 1.38.1\n  * doc: deprecate process.umask() with no arguments\n  * module:\n    + package 'imports' field\n    + module: deprecate module.parent\n  * n-api: create N-API version 7\n  * zlib: switch to lazy init for zlib streams\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update update project.",
