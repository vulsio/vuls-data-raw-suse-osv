	"details": "This update for teeworlds fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2019-10879: An integer overflow in CDataFileReader::Open() could have lead to a buffer overflow and possibly remote code execution, because size-related multiplications were mishandled. (boo#1131729)\n- CVE-2019-10878: A failed bounds check in CDataFileReader::GetData() and CDataFileReader::ReplaceData() and related functions could have lead to an arbitrary free and out-of-bounds pointer write, possibly resulting in remote code execution.\n- CVE-2019-10877: An integer overflow in CMap::Load() could have lead to a buffer overflow, because multiplication of width and height were mishandled.\n- CVE-2018-18541: Connection packets could have been forged. There was no challenge-response involved in the connection build up. A remote attacker could have sent connection packets from a spoofed IP address and occupy all server slots, or even use them for a reflection attack using map download packets.

Click to discover them!\n  * animated background menu map: jungle, heavens (day/night themes,\n    customisable in the map editor)\n  * new design for the menus: added start menus, reworked server\n    browser, settings\n  * customisable gametype icons (browser). make your own!\n  * chat overhaul, whispers (private messages)\n  * composed binds (ctrl+, shift+, alt+)\n  * scoreboard remodelled, now shows kills/deaths\n  * demo markers\n  * master server list cache (in case the masters are unreachable)\n  * input separated from rendering (optimisation)\n  * upgrade to SDL2. support for multiple monitors, non-english\n    keyboards, and more\n  * broadcasts overhaul, optional colours support\n  * ready system, for competitive settings\n  * server difficulty setting (casual, competitive, normal), shown in\n    the browser\n  * spectator mode improvements: follow flags, click on players\n  * bot flags for modified servers: indicate NPCs, can be filtered out\n    in the server browser\n  * sharper graphics all around (no more tileset_borderfix and dilate)\n  * refreshed the HUD, ninja cooldown, new mouse cursor\n  * mapres update (higher resolution, fixes...)\n",
