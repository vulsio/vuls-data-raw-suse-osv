	"details": "This update for runc fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity vulnerablities addressed:\n\n- CVE-2019-5736: Effectively copying /proc/self/exe during re-exec to avoid\n  write attacks to the host runc binary, which could lead to a container\n  breakout (bsc#1121967)\n- CVE-2018-16873: Fix a remote command execution during 'go get -u'\n  (boo#1118897)\n- CVE-2018-16874: Fix a directory traversal in 'go get' via curly braces in\n  import paths (boo#1118898)\n- CVE-2018-16875: Fix a CPU denial of service issue (boo#1118899)\n\nOther changes and bug fixes:\n\n- Update go requirements to >= go1.10\n- Create a symlink in /usr/bin/runc to enable rootless Podman and Buildah.\n- Make use of %license macro\n- Remove 'go test' from %check section, as it has only ever caused us problems\n  and hasn't (as far as I remember) ever caught a release-blocking issue. Smoke\n  testing has been far more useful. (boo#1095817)\n- Upgrade to runc v1.0.0~rc6. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc6\n",
