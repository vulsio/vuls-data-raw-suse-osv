It will offer the\n  installation of a 3rd party add-on (Owl) which supports that\n  protocol.\n* Thunderbird now compatible with other WebExtension-based\n  FileLink add-ons like the Dropbox add-on\n* New WebExtensions FileLink API to facilitate add-ons\n* Fix decoding problems for messages with less common charsets\n  (cp932, cp936)\n* New messages in the drafts folder (and other special or virtual\n  folders) will no longer be included in the new messages\n  notification\n* Thunderbird 60 will migrate security databases (key3.db, cert8.db\n  to key4.db, cert9.db). Thunderbird 60.3.2 and earlier contained a\n  fault that potentially deleted saved passwords and private certificate\n  keys for users using a master password. Version 60.3.3 will prevent\n  the loss of data; affected users who have already upgraded to version\n  60.3.2 or earlier can restore the deleted key3.db file from backup\n  to complete the migration.\n* Address book search and auto-complete slowness introduced in\n  Thunderbird 60.3.2\n* Plain text markup with * for bold, / for italics, _ for underline\n  and | for code did not work when the enclosed text contained\n  non-ASCII characters\n* While composing a message, a link not removed when link location\n  was removed in the link properties panel\n* Encoding problems when exporting address books or messages using\n  the system charset. Messages are now always exported using the\n  UTF-8 encoding\n* If the 'Date' header of a message was invalid, Jan 1970 or Dec 1969\n  was displayed. Now using date from 'Received' header instead.\n* Body search/filtering didn't reliably ignore content of tags\n* Inappropriate warning 'Thunderbird prevented the site\n  (addons.thunderbird.net) from asking you to install software on\n  your computer' when installing add-ons\n* Incorrect display of correspondents column since own email\n  address was not always detected\n* Spurious &#xA; (encoded newline) inserted into drafts and sent email\n* Double-clicking on a word in the Write window sometimes\n  launched the Advanced Property Editor or Link Properties dialog\n* Fixe Cookie removal\n* 'Download rest of message' was not working if global inbox was\n  used\n* Fix Encoding problems for users (especially in Poland) when a\n  file was sent via a folder using 'Sent to > Mail recipient'\n  due to a problem in the Thunderbird MAPI interface\n* According to RFC 4616 and RFC 5721, passwords containing\n  non-ASCII characters are encoded using UTF-8 which can lead to\n  problems with non-compliant providers, for example\n  office365.com. The SMTP LOGIN and POP3 USER/PASS\n  authentication methods are now using a Latin-1 encoding again\n  to work around this issue\n* Fix shutdown crash/hang after entering an empty IMAP password\n",
