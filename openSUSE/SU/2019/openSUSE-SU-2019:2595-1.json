	"details": "This update for clamav fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issue fixed:\n\n- CVE-2019-12625: Fixed a ZIP bomb issue by adding detection and heuristics for zips with overlapping files (bsc#1144504).\n- CVE-2019-12900: Fixed an out-of-bounds write in decompress.c with many selectors (bsc#1149458).\n\nNon-security issues fixed:\n\n- Added the --max-scantime clamscan option and MaxScanTime clamd configuration option (bsc#1144504).\n- Increased the startup timeout of clamd to 5 minutes to cater for the grown virus database as a workaround until clamd has learned to talk to systemd to extend the timeout as long as needed (bsc#1151839).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.",
