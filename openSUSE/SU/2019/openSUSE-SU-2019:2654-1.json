	"details": "This update for calamares fixes the following issues:\n\n- Launch with 'pkexec calamares' in openSUSE Tumbleweed, but\n  launch with 'xdg-su -c calamares' in openSUSE Leap 15.\n\nUpdate to Calamares 3.2.15:\n\n- 'displaymanager' module now treats 'sysconfig' as a regular \n  entry in the 'displaymanagers' list, and the 'sysconfigSetup' \n  key is used as a shorthand to force only that entry in the \n  list.\n- 'machineid' module has been re-written in C++ and extended \n  with a new configuration key to generate urandom pool data.\n- 'unpackfs' now supports a special 'sourcefs' value of file \n  for copying single files (optionally with renaming) or \n  directory trees to the target system.\n- 'unpackfs' now support an 'exclude' and 'excludeFile' setting \n  for excluding particular files or patters from unpacking.\n\nUpdate to Calamares 3.2.14:\n- 'locale' module no longer recognizes the legacy GeoIP \n  configuration. This has been deprecated since Calamares 3.2.8 \n  and is now removed.\n- 'packagechooser' module can now be custom-labeled in the overall\n  progress (left-hand column).\n- 'displaymanager' module now recognizes KDE Plasma 5.17.\n- 'displaymanager' module now can handle Wayland sessions and can\n  detect sessions from their .desktop files.\n- 'unpackfs' now has special handling for sourcefs setting “file”. \n\nUpdate to Calamares 3.2.13.\n\nMore about upstream changes:\n\n  https://calamares.io/calamares-3.2.13-is-out/ and\n  https://calamares.io/calamares-3.2.12-is-out/\n\nUpdate to Calamares 3.2.11:\n\n- Fix race condition in modules/luksbootkeyfile/main.py \n  (boo#1140256, CVE-2019-13178)\n- more about upstream changes in 3.2 versions can be found in \n  https://calamares.io/ and \n  https://github.com/calamares/calamares/releases\n\n\nThis update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.0:Update update project.",
