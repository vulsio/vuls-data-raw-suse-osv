	"summary": "Security update for python-django-ckeditor",
	"details": "This update for python-django-ckeditor fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update to 6.7.2\n  * Deprecated the package.\n  * Added a new ckeditor/fixups.js script which disables the version check again \n    (if something slips through by accident) and which disables the behavior \n    where CKEditor 4 would automatically attach itself to unrelated HTML elements \n    with a contenteditable attribute (see CKEDITOR.disableAutoInline in the \n    CKEditor 4 docs).\n- CVE-2024-24815: Fixed bypass of Advanced Content Filtering mechanism (boo#1219720)\n\n- update to 6.7.1:\n  * Add Python 3.12, Django 5.0\n  * Silence the CKEditor version check/nag but include a system check warning\n\n- update to 6.7.0:\n  * Dark mode fixes.\n  * Added support for Pillow 10.\n\n- update to 6.6.1:\n  * Required a newer version of django-js-asset which actually works\n    with Django 4.1.\n  * CKEditor 4.21.0\n  * Fixed the CKEditor styles when used with the dark Django admin theme.\n\n- update to 6.5.1:\n  * Avoided calling ``static()`` if ``CKEDITOR_BASEPATH`` is defined.\n  * Fixed ``./manage.py generateckeditorthumbnails`` to work again after the\n    image uploader backend rework.\n  * CKEditor 4.19.1\n  * Stopped calling ``static()`` during application startup.\n  * Added Django 4.1\n  * Changed the context for the widget to deviate less from Django. Removed a\n  * few template variables which are not used in the bundled\n  * ``ckeditor/widget.html`` template. This only affects you if you are using a\n  * customized widget or widget template.\n  * Dropped support for Python < 3.8, Django < 3.2.\n  * Added a pre-commit configuration.\n  * Added a GitHub action for running tests.\n  * Made selenium tests require opt in using a ``SELENIUM=firefox`` or\n    ``SELENIUM=chromium`` environment variable.\n  * Made it possible to override the CKEditor template in the widget class.\n  * Changed ``CKEDITOR_IMAGE_BACKEND`` to require dotted module paths (the old\n    identifiers are still supported for now).\n",
