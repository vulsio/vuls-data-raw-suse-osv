	"summary": "Security update for openjpeg2",
	"details": "This update for openjpeg2 fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2016-10507: Integer overflow vulnerability in the bmp24toimage function\n  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer\n  over-read and application crash) via a crafted bmp file (bsc#1056421).\n- CVE-2017-14039: A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the\n  opj_t2_encode_packet function. The vulnerability caused an out-of-bounds write,\n  which may have lead to remote denial of service or possibly unspecified other\n  impact (bsc#1056622).\n- CVE-2017-14164: A size-validation issue was discovered in opj_j2k_write_sot.\n  The vulnerability caused an out-of-bounds write, which may have lead to remote\n  DoS or possibly remote code execution (bsc#1057511).\n- CVE-2017-14040: An invalid write access was discovered in bin/jp2/convert.c,\n  triggering a crash in the tgatoimage function. The vulnerability may have lead\n  to remote denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact (bsc#1056621).\n- CVE-2017-14041: A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the\n  pgxtoimage function. The vulnerability caused an out-of-bounds write, which may\n  have lead to remote denial of service or possibly remote code execution\n  (bsc#1056562).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update update project.",
