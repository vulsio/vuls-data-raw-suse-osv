	"summary": "Security update for perl-HTTP-Tiny",
	"details": "This update for perl-HTTP-Tiny fixes the following issues:\n\nperl-HTTP-Tiny was updated to 0.086:\n\nsee /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-HTTP-Tiny/Changes\n\n0.086     2023-06-22 10:06:37-04:00 America/New_York\n\n    - Fix code to use `$ENV{PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT}` as documented.\n\n0.084     2023-06-14 06:35:01-04:00 America/New_York\n\n    - No changes from 0.083-TRIAL.\n\n0.083     2023-06-11 07:05:45-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)\n\n    [!!! SECURITY !!!]\n    - Changes the `verify_SSL` default parameter from `0` to `1`.\n      Fixes CVE-2023-31486 (boo#1211002)\n    - `$ENV{PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT}` can be used to restore the\n      old default if required.\n\n0.081     2022-07-17 09:01:51-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)\n\n      [FIXED]\n      - No longer deletes the 'headers' key from post_form arguments hashref.\n      [DOCS]\n      - Noted that request/response content are handled as raw bytes.\n\n0.079     2021-11-04 12:33:43-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)\n\n      [FIXED]\n      - Fixed uninitialized value warnings on older Perls when the REQUEST_METHOD\n        environment variable is set and CGI_HTTP_PROXY is not.\n\n0.077     2021-07-22 13:07:14-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)\n\n      [ADDED]\n\n      - Added a `patch` helper method for the HTTP `PATCH` verb.\n      - If the REQUEST_METHOD environment variable is set, then CGI_HTTP_PROXY\n        replaces HTTP_PROXY.\n\n      [FIXED]\n\n      - Unsupported scheme errors early without giving an uninitialized value\n        warning first.\n      - Sends Content-Length: 0 on empty body PUT/POST.  This is not in the spec,\n        but some servers require this.\n      - Allows optional status line reason, as clarified in RFC 7230.\n      - Ignore SIGPIPE on reads as well as writes, as IO::Socket::SSL says that\n        SSL reads can also send writes as a side effect.\n      - Check if a server has closed a connection before preserving it for reuse.\n\n      [DOCS]\n\n      - Clarified that exceptions/errors result in 599 status codes.\n\n      [PREREQS]\n\n      - Optional IO::Socket::IP prereq must be at least version 0.32 to be used.\n        This ensures correct timeout support.\n\n0.076     2018-08-05 21:07:38-04:00 America/New_York\n  \n      - No changes from 0.075-TRIAL.\n  \n0.075     2018-08-01 07:03:36-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)\n  \n      [CHANGED] - The 'peer' option now also can take a code reference\n\n0.073     2018-07-24 11:33:53-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)\n  \n      [DOCS] - Documented 'protocol' field in response hash.\n  \n0.071     2018-04-22 14:45:43+02:00 Europe/Oslo (TRIAL RELEASE)\n  \n      [DOCS] - Documented that method argument to request() is case-sensitive.\n  \n",
